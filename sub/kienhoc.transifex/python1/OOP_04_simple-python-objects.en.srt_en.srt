1
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:11,800
https://youtu.be/MkfuqueC3Qc
So enough with the pictures, and
enough with the terminology.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,010
It's time to write some code.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,660
So we're going to actually
write a sample class.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,950
It's not going to do anything useful
whatsoever, but here we go.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,970
So here is our class PartyAnimal, okay?

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:29,270
And it's a kind of an animal, and it has,
inside this, class is a new reserved word.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,310
Like def, or break, or continue,
class is a reserved word.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,490
This is, we're defining, and
it's kind of like a def.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,830
Remember the def doesn't actually execute,
it just remembers.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:46,720
So class says, remember this template,
and I'm naming the template PartyAnimal.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,180
I haven't made any objects yet,
but this is the class.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,080
And then for inside this, we indent and
we just simply say oh, x = 0 and

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,160
that's a variable that's part
of every instance of this class.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,256
And then, if we want to do a method,
we have some code like the def,

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,756
and that's indented.

16
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:10,072
And then it indents even farther, right,
so it's indented to be part of this class

17
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:13,660
because that's part of the class, and
then we do def, which means here.

18
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,421
So you could have multiple of these,
we're just not showing multiple of those.

19
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:21,102
And so we have the name of the method,
which is party, and

20
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,340
then we have a parameter.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,350
Now, if you're familiar with other
object oriented languages, one thing

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,210
that's different about Python than other
object oriented langues is the concept of

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,530
a variable that is
an alias to the instance,

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,260
which we'll cover in more detail.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,690
And so the first parameter,
by convention, not by requirement, but

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,800
by convention, is always self.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,020
And then if you have more parameters,
you put them after this.

28
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,919
So pretty much every method
has to have one parameter

29
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:54,387
if it wants to talk to
the instance variables.

30
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:57,957
And then within the code,
it has this thing called self, and

31
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:01,715
that says there will be many x's,
which we'll see in a bit.

32
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:04,470
self.x is a way to talk within

33
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,100
an instance of an object to the x that's
part of the particular object we're doing.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,950
And so
you'll see these things to go to these.

35
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,780
We could have like a = 2.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,110
Those aren't object-wide variables,
that's just a local variable in that code.

37
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,730
So self.x is a way, and
I'll cover that in a bit.

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,808
So there's a bit of code in there,
has some rules,

39
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,950
the self parameter,
which we'll come back to.

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,150
And then what happens is, so
this part here gets all just recorded and

41
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,520
it remembers it in the name PartyAnimal.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,690
And now we're saying that we want
to actually create an object, okay?

43
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,680
So this is a class and
now we're going to create an instance.

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,780
So we basically say, call the PartyAnimal
thing, and make me a PartyAnimal object,

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,830
and return me the PartyAnimal object,
and put it in the variable an, okay?

46
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,310
So now at this point,
the variable an is an object, and

47
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,710
we can do things to it based on
the definition of the class.

48
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,590
So we can call the party method, and
we can call the method again, and

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,120
we can call the party method again.

50
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,180
Now, to just sort of clarify this, not that
we have to fully understand this right

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,820
now, but since an is of type PartyAnimal,

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,920
the way this works is,
it calls PartyAnimal.party,

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,420
which is this code right here, and
passes in the instance variable an.

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,160
So this, you can think of this as
almost a syntactic transformation

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,870
where this code is being called and
this is being passed in, and

56
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,410
that's how this self
becomes an alias of an.

57
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,950
And again, we'll hit this later and it
will make some more sense, but I'll just

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:49,550
put this here as these two things,
this is like a short form of this, okay?

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,380
So if we watch this code run,
okay, like I said,

60
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,450
as Python encounters the class,
it's like the def and

61
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,700
it simply records this and defines
the new concept PartyAnimal, right?

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,600
And so, when the program runs,
no output happens,

63
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,720
it just remembers I got a template,
I got a cookie cutter named PartyAnimal.

64
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,430
I can make as many of these
PartyAnimals as I like.

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,034
And then we hit a line basically says,
make me a PartyAnimal and

66
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,418
give me back an instance of PartyAnimal.

67
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,993
And I´m going to, I mean this is like
a function that gives you an instance and

68
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:26,358
then there´s an assignment
statement that says,

69
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:29,660
put that object into the variable an,
and that's what happens there.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,080
And at this point, Python uses this
class to create a variable called an.

71
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,960
And it says, oh,
there is a variable x inside of an, and

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,150
a bit of code called party inside of an.

73
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,880
So this little green box here, that is
the object, and it has stuff inside of it.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,586
Code and data, and this object is created

75
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:59,703
when we construct a new PartyAnimal, okay?

76
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:04,486
So now we're going to call the method
the first time, and so if you look,

77
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:09,830
that effectively fires into party and
starts running that code.

78
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,680
And self.x is this thing, and so now it

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,890
changes that from 0 to 1, and
it then prints out, So far 1, okay?

80
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,000
Then the def returns, and
then it comes back to the main program

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,170
just like a function would, and
it says, oh, let's call party again.

82
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,270
So it goes back up again,
and it runs the code.

83
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,800
It adds 1, so this becomes 2,
and then it prints out So far 2.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,460
And then it comes back to here.

85
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,430
And then it runs the code again.

86
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,020
It goes up, runs this code,
this x within switches from 2 to 3,

87
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,960
then it prints out So far 3, and
then it comes back down here.

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,840
So this function has access
to all the data that

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,310
lives inside this object while
the function is running.

90
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,110
And it's using self as
the way to access this thing.

91
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,210
So you can think of this as,
self is an alias to the an.

92
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,925
Out here,
an is a variable that we've got and

93
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,431
we can just do stuff to
an in our main code.

94
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:21,176
But we don't know about an here,
but while this code is running,

95
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:27,700
when we call an.party, self is
an alias to an because of this, okay?

96
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,460
So self is like a global variable
that's throughout this whole thing.

97
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,750
And it's a way that we access
the actual instance of the object.

98
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,540
See, I told you how much fun this was.

99
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,705
No, I'm just kidding.

100
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:42,960
So, so far we've talked
about class, which is a template.

101
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,950
Just for review, the methods or
message is the code that's within there.

102
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,080
There's also fields or attributes,
which is the data in there.

103
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
And an instance is, when you use
the class to make an object, and

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,460
then you have an object instance.

105
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,070
It's the particular instance of a class.

106
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,080
Okay, so if we take a look at this,

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,350
what we're really doing is making
new types of variables, right?

108
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,060
So we have like integers, and
floating point numbers, and strings,

109
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,920
and Boolean, and whatever.

110
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,690
But what we have done with class,
is we've made our own type of variable.

111
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,830
And so if you recall, if we make a list,

112
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,260
and we say what kind of thing are you
with type, and it says, oh I'm a list.

113
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,140
And then remember what dir does,
dir basically tells us,

114
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,230
what are the capabilities of this?

115
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,850
Now, now we have a word for this.

116
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,980
These things in list, like extend,
count, pop, remove, reverse, sort.

117
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,380
These are methods.

118
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,590
List is a class that's already built in.

119
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,940
x is an object that we get back from it,
and we say, what kind of thing is x?

120
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,420
Well, it's a list object.

121
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,330
Oh, when we say dir of x, we say,
what is x capable of doing?

122
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,700
And we see all of the methods.

123
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,220
Append, index, insert, so
these are called methods.

124
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,660
We've been using them all along, okay?

125
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:09,440
So that is dir and type on classes and
instances that we've been using so far.

126
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,430
Okay, and so remember,
when we did dir with a string,

127
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,960
we make a new string object,
we assign it into y.

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,220
That's the long version of that.

129
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,210
We ask, what's in it?

130
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,760
Oh, we got an rindex, we got a split,
we got this, we got expandtabs.

131
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,670
We've got all these,
these are again, methods.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,513
Turns out that these are also methods as
well, with special names that have to do

133
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,984
with supporting things like greater than,
which supports the greater than operator.

134
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,944
And less than is one that gets
called when we see syntax like,

135
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:48,700
if I see like x less than y, and these
are strings, it actually calls this method.

136
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,460
Not that you need to know that, okay.

137
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,010
rindex or isupper, those are things that
we call when we want to accomplish things.

138
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,000
So every string has all
of these methods in it.

139
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,580
Let's take a look at
the thing we just made.

140
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,930
So we made a thing called
class PartyAnimal.

141
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,930
Python reads that and says,
oh, I'm going to make a template

142
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,520
that's shaped like a PartyAnimal,
so we shape like a PartyAnimal.

143
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,570
And it's got some code in it,
it's got a variable in it.

144
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,460
And we're going to make an instance
of it and assign the instance

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,640
in the an variable, and now we're going
to say, what kind of thing is an?

146
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,160
Print its type.

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,340
And then dir says print all the methods.

148
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,160
And so type says it is an instance,

149
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,380
which means it's an instance of
an object or instance of a class.

150
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,007
And we do dir, it says well we can call
doc and module, those are built in.

151
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:43,080
party, that's our party.

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,230
x, that's our x, and so Python itself
knows the member functions and

153
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,295
the attributes in a class that we created.

154
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:56,715
Okay, so that basically gets
us through some of the syntax,

155
00:09:56,715 --> 00:09:59,799
the concept of self,
the fact that self is the alias for

156
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,184
the actual instance, and then we'll
continue and do some more in just a bit.
