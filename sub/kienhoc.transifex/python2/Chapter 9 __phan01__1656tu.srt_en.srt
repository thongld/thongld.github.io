Hello again, and welcome to
Chapter 9, Python dictionaries.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,520
As always this lecture is

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,570
and even my scribbles you
can use in any way you like.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,850
As long as you attribute them.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,117
OK so, this is
the second chapter

8
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:21,450
we're talking about collections.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,741
And the collections are kind
of like a piece of luggage

10
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:27,890
in that you can put
multiple things in them.

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,470
Variables that
we've talked about,

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,479
sort of starting in chapter
two and chapter three,

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,520
were simple variables.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,580
Scaler, they're just kind of
one thing and soon as you like,

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,610
put another thing in there it
overwrites the first thing.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,810
So, if you look at the code
x equals 2 and x equals 4,

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,220
the question is you know,
where did the two go?

18
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,230
All right the two was
there, x was there,

19
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,490
there was a two in there,
and then we cross it out

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,720
and put four in there.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,180
This is sort of the basic
operation, the assignment

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,210
statement it's a replacement.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,060
But a dictionary allows us to
put more than one thing, not

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,140
using this syntax,
but it allows us

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,380
to have a variable that's really
an aggregate of many values

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,460
and the difference between
a list and a dictionary,

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,080
is how the values are structured
within that single variable.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,820
The list is a linear collection
indexed by integers, zero, one,

29
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,120
two, three.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,460
If there's five of them,
it's zero through four.

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,396
Very much like a
Pringles can here,

32
00:01:25,396 --> 00:01:26,770
where they're just
stacked nicely

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,880
on top of each other,
everything's kind of organized.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,730
We talked about in
the last lecture,

35
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,660
this lecture we're talking
about dictionaries.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,220
Dictionaries' very powerful,
and it's power comes from

37
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,170
a different way of
organizing itself internally.

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,370
It's a bag of values,
like a, just a, sort of,

39
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,200
just stuffs in it, it's not
in any order, big stuff,

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,729
little stuff,
things have labels.

41
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,020
You can also think of it like
a purse, with just things

42
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,480
and it's like, it's
not like stacked,

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,690
it's just stuff moves
around as you're going.

44
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,560
And that's a very good
model for dictionaries.

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,230
And so dictionaries have to have
a label, because the stuff is

46
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,930
not an order.

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,920
There's no such thing
as the third thing.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,066
There is the thing
with a label perfume.

49
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,690
There's the thing
with the label candy,

50
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,080
there's the thing
with the label money.

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
And so there's the value, the
thing, the money, and then

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,410
there's always also the label.

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,800
We also call these key value.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,090
The key is the label, and
the value is whatever.

55
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,890
And so these pink things are
all labels for various things

56
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,110
that you could put in the purse,
so you could say to your purse,

57
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,480
hey purse give me my tissues,
hey purse give me my money

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,510
and it's in there somewhere
and the purse sort of gives you

59
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,300
back the tissues or the money.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,246
And it's-- Python's most
powerful data collection is

61
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:48,870
the dictionary.

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,827
And when you get used
to wielding them,

63
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,160
you'll say like whoa I can
do so much with these things.

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,480
And at the beginning you're
just sort of learning,

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,417
sort of how to use them
without hurting yourself.

66
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:00,500
But they're very powerful.

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,870
It's like a database.

68
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,870
It allows you to store very
arbitrary data organized

69
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,020
in however you feel
like organizing it,

70
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,661
in a way that advances the
cause the program that you're

71
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,160
writing.

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
We're still kind of
at the very beginning,

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,790
but as you learn more,
these will become

74
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,770
a very powerful tool for you.

75
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,680
Dictionaries have different
names in different languages.

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,920
Perl or Php would call
them Associative Arrays,

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,010
Java would call them a
Property Map or a HashMap,

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,930
and C# might call them a
Property Bag or an Attribute

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,430
Bag.

80
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,100
And so they're just
the same concept,

81
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,620
it's keys and values
is the concept,

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,560
that's across all
these languages, just

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,657
a very powerful one.

84
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,990
And if you look at the Wikipedia
entry that I have here,

85
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,424
you can see that it's
just, it's a concept

86
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:50,590
that we give different names
in different languages.

87
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,130
Same concept, different names.

88
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,200
So like I said, the
difference between a list

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,560
and a dictionary, they both
can store multiple values.

90
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,030
The question is how we label
them, how we store them,

91
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,250
and how we retrieve them.

92
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,630
So here's an example
use of a dictionary.

93
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,370
I'm going to make a
thing called purse,

94
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,320
and I'm going to
store in purse, this

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,830
is an assignment statement,
purse sub money so this isn't

96
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,100
like sub zero, this is money.

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,200
So I'm actually using
a string as the place.

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,029
And so I'm going to say
stick 12 in my purse,

99
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,630
and stick us posted note,
that's my money, candy is three,

100
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,290
tissues is 75.

101
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,260
And if I look at that, it's not
just the numbers 12, 3 and 75

102
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,460
as it would be in a list, it
is the connection between money

103
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,150
and 12, tissues is
75, candy is three.

104
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,960
And in the key value, that's
the key and that's the value.

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,580
So candy is the key,
and three is the value.

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,390
Now I can look things up by
their name, print purse sub

107
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,890
candy.

108
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,580
Well goes finds it, asking
hey purse give me that candy,

109
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,690
and it goes and finds the
value which is three and so

110
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,630
outcomes a three.

111
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,480
We can also put it on the right
hand side of an assignment

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,980
statement.

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,550
So purse of candy says give
me the old version of candy,

114
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,340
and then add two to
it, which gives me 5.

115
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,900
And then store it back in that
purse, under the label candy.

116
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,470
So we see candy
changing to five.

117
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,041
And so, this is a place, and
you could do this with a list

118
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,290
except these would be numbers.

119
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,360
You could say purse sub
2 is equal to purse sub

120
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,500
2 plus 2 or whatever.

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,540
But in dictionaries,
there are labels.

122
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,940
Now they're not strings.

123
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,140
Strings is a very common
label in dictionaries,

124
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,310
but it's not always strings.

125
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,510
You can use other things.

126
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,930
In this chapter we'll pretty
much focus on strings.

127
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,100
You could even use
numbers and then you

128
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,940
would get a little
confused, but you can.

129
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,240
So here's sort of a
picture of how this works.

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,000
So if we take a look at this
line purse sub money equals 12,

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,360
it's like we are putting
a key value connection,

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,690
money is the label for 12, and
then we sort of move that n.

133
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,330
And it's up to the purse
to decide m things live.

134
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,800
If we look at the
next line, we're

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,290
going to put the value n three
with n with the label candy,

136
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,490
and we're going to put the value
75 in with a label of tissues.

137
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,270
And when we say hey
purse print yourself out,

138
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,630
it just goes and pulls
these things back out

139
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,790
and hands them to her.

140
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,290
And what it's really,
it's giving us

141
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,728
both the label and the value.

142
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,853
And it's necessary to do
that, because there's just

143
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,090
12, 75 and three,
what exactly is that?

144
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,460
And so this syntax
with the curly braces

145
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,880
is what happens when you
print a dictionary out.

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,630
The same thing happens when
we're sort of printing purse

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,650
sub candy.

148
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,390
Right?

149
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,520
Purse sub candy, it's
like, you're first,

150
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,870
go and find the candy
thing, look at that one,

151
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,340
look at that one, oh
yep yep this is candy.

152
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,200
But what we're looking
for is the value,

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,580
and so that's why three
is coming up here.

154
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,080
So go look up under
candy and tell me

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,242
what's stored under candy.

156
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,950
These can be actually
more complex things

157
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,880
and I'm just keeping it
simple for this lecture.

158
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,050
And then when we say purse
sub candy equals purse sub

159
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,540
candy plus 2, well
it pulls the three

160
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,650
out looking at the label
candy, then adds 3 plus 2

161
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,940
and makes five, and then
it assigns it back in.

162
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,460
And then that says oh
go go place this number

163
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,930
five in the purse with
the label of candy,

164
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,460
which then replaces
the three with a five.

165
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,570
OK and if we print
it out, we see

166
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:35,390
that the new variable, or the
new candy entry is now five.

167
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,880
OK?

168
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,470
So if we just sort of put
these things side by side,

169
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,340
we create them sort
of both the same way

170
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,960
and we make an empty
list an empty dictionary.

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,670
We call the append method
because we're sort of just

172
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,980
putting these things in order.

173
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,700
You've got to put the
first one in first.

174
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,120
So it's not telling you
where, you kind of know

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,300
that this would be the
first one because you're

176
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,800
starting with an empty one, and
this will be the second one.

177
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,120
We put in the values 21 and
183 and then we print it out

178
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,320
and it's like OK, you gave
me the value as 21 and 183.

179
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,600
I will maintain
the order for you,

180
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,700
there's no keys other
than their position.

181
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,330
Position is the key, as it were.

182
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,620
If I want to change
the first one to 23,

183
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,510
well, I say lists of
zero which is this,

184
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,890
and then change that to 23.

185
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,354
So this is sort of used as
a look up to find something.

186
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,770
Can be used on either the right
hand side or the left hand

187
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,370
side of the science statement.

188
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,710
Comparing that to dictionaries,
I want to put a 21 in there

189
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,160
and I'm going to put
it with the label age,

190
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,530
and put 182, put that in
with the label course.

191
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,440
So, so we don't have
to like make an entry.

192
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,850
The fact that the entry doesn't
exist, it creates the age entry

193
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,289
and sticks 21 into it.

194
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,700
Creates the course entry,
sticks 182 into it,

195
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,240
we print it out and says, oh
course is 182 and age is 21.

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,720
This emphasizes that order is
not preserved in dictionaries.

197
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,054
