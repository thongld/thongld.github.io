601
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,860
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ZQ-rf6iIc
so, 11 months after you
launch, or

602
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,630
first publicly talk about what
you're doing.

603
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,750
Is a good time to file
provisional patents.

604
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,570
We recommend people just file
provisional patents.

605
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,200
All that does is just hold
your place in line at

606
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,050
the patent office and it gives
you another year to decide if

607
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,060
you want to patent something
or not.

608
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,620
It only costs about $1000.

609
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,780
It takes way less effort than
a full patent.

610
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,360
And most of the time you'll
know whether or

611
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,820
not you need full patent a
year later.

612
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,170
But if you just do this one
step,

613
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,080
you'll at least have the
option.

614
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,660
It's also a good time to file
trademarks for the U.S. and

615
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,460
major international markets.

616
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,300
again, if you don't do this at
this stage,

617
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,050
most people end up regretting
it.

618
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,468
And while you're at it, a good
time to grab all the domains.

619
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:30,090
FP&A, good time also I think
to

620
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,860
think about someone to start
doing FP&A.

621
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,210
I think most companies don't
end up realizing where

622
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,950
the knobs on their financial
model are until far too late.

623
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,050
And I think it turns out that
if you have

624
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,110
someone build a really great
model of the business.

625
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,990
And by really great,
apparently Roelof Botha,

626
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,320
who was the PayPal CFO and
built their FP&A model.

627
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,420
The top, the, like,

628
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,520
the top sheet of his
spreadsheet was 1,500 lines,

629
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,100
just as a level of the detail
people build these to.

630
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,840
But you can really optimize
the business and understand it

631
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,300
at a level that I think most
people totally miss.

632
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,310
Most people don't hire someone
like

633
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,390
this until they're many
hundreds of employees.

634
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,060
I think it's worth hiring
earlier.

635
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
Another thing that I think is
worth hiring earlier

636
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,780
that almost no one does is a
full time fundraiser.

637
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,620
Let's say you hire someone
like really, really great and

638
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,670
their full time job is to
raise money for the company.

639
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,840
You hire them after your b
round.

640
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,190
And you say, you know what,

641
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,520
by the time we raise our c
round we want the evaluation

642
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,020
to be double what it would
have been otherwise.

643
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,490
You almost certainly get
better results than if you

644
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,380
hire an investive banker or
someone else if it's just

645
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,490
someone internal to the
company and you end up paying

646
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,570
way less money, and take like
literally half the dilution.

647
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,990
So, I think this is one of
these like, slightly none

648
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,740
obvious optimizations that
people just failed to make.

649
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,320
Tax structuring, so, this is
another thing.

650
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,330
most, once things are working.

651
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,120
It would be worth you spending
a little bit of time thinking

652
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,080
about how you set up the tax
structure for the company.

653
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
I confess, I don't know a lot
about the details here

654
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,260
because I just find it
personally really boring.

655
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,300
But like somehow if you assign
all the IP to like some

656
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,890
corporation in Ireland that
licenses it back to the U.S.

657
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,050
corporation, you end up paying
like no tax, no corporate tax.

658
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,420
But I know you can only do
that like relatively early on.

659
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,380
And this ends up being a huge
issue for companies that

660
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,340
don't do it that compete with
companies that do do it.

661
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,700
You know once they're big,
public companies.

662
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,610
So that's worth doing.

663
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,510
A lot of people throughout the
class have talked about

664
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,750
your own psychology as a
founder.

665
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,630
Here's what they haven't said.

666
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,380
It gets worse, not better.

667
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,030
As the company grows, you
continue to oscillate.

668
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,990
The highs are better but the
lows keep getting worse.

669
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,950
And, you, you really want to
think about this early on and

670
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,570
just be aware this is going to
happen.

671
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,490
And try to try to manage your
own psychology through

672
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,740
the expanding swings that it's
going to go through.

673
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,180
Another thing that happens as
you begin to be successful.

674
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,620
As you go from being someone
that most people rooted for,

675
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,970
kind of the underdog,

676
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,760
to someone that a lot of
people start hating on.

677
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,490
And you know,

678
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,470
you see this first in internet
commenters who will be,

679
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,190
like, I can't believe this
**** company raised money.

680
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,850
It **** sucks, like, awful.

681
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,150
And it only bothers you a
little bit, but then, like,

682
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,430
journalists that you kind of
care about start writing this,

683
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,310
and it just goes on and on.

684
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,930
This also will go on and on as
you get more and

685
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,060
more successful, and

686
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,390
you just have to make peace
with this early.

687
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,100
But if you don't,

688
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,760
it will bother you all the way
through.

689
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,990
This is also a good time to
start thinking about

690
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,090
how long of a journey this is
going to be.

691
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,870
Very few founders think long
term.

692
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,930
Most founders think kind of a
year in advance.

693
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,320
And they think that you know
what

694
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,370
in three years I'm going to
sell my company and either I'm

695
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,710
going to become a VC or sit on
the beach or something.

696
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,800
Because so

697
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,530
few people make an actual long
term commitment to what

698
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,400
they're building, the ones
that do have a huge advantage.

699
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,760
They're, they're in a very
rarefied class, and so this is

700
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,150
a good time to like sit around
with your cofounders and

701
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,490
decide, you know what, we're
going to work on this for

702
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,710
a very long time.

703
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,940
And we're going to build a
strategy that assumes that

704
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,184
we're going to be doing this
for the next ten years.

705
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:24,664
Just thinking that way alone,
I think is probably,

706
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:28,295
a very high leverage thing you
can do for success.

707
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:29,150
Take vacation.

708
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,560
Another common thing that we
see is founders will run their

709
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,950
business for three or four
years, without ever taking,

710
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,650
you know, more than a day of
vacation.

711
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,460
And that works for like a
year, or two years, or

712
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,730
something like that.

713
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,410
It really leads to nasty
burnout if you don't do it.

714
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,090
Losing focus is another way
that founders get off track.

715
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,180
I actually think this is a
symptom of burnout.

716
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,960
When you get really burned out
on running the business,

717
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,370
you want to do easier things,
or

718
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,480
sort of more gratifying
things.

719
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,970
You want to go to conferences,
and

720
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,630
have people tell you how great
you are.

721
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,990
You know, you want to do all
these things that are not

722
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,550
actually building the
business.

723
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,020
And the most common post-YC
failure case for

724
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,960
the companies we fund is that
they're incredibly focused,

725
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,260
during YC, on their company,
and then after,

726
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,160
they start doing a lot of
other things.

727
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,660
You know, they, they advise
companies.

728
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
They go to conferences,
whatever.

729
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,010
Focus is what made you
successful in the first place.

730
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,420
There are a lot of reasons
people lose focus, but

731
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,880
fight against that really,
really hard.

732
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,690
This is a special case of
focus.

733
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
As you start to do well.

734
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,780
You will start to get a bunch
of potential acquires

735
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,470
sniffing around.

736
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,560
And it's very gratifying.

737
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,270
And you're like wow, I can be
so rich and that'd be so cool.

738
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,240
And negotiations feel really
fun.

739
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,360
This is one the biggest
killers of, of companies is

740
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,590
that they entertain
acquisition conversations.

741
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,040
You, you distract yourself.

742
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,310
You get demoralized if it
doesn't happen.

743
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,370
If an offer does come in and
it's really low,

744
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,290
you've already like mentally
thought that you're done, and

745
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,190
so you take the offer.

746
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,620
As a general rule, don't start
any acquisition conversation

747
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,030
unless you're willing to sell
for a pretty low number.

748
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,800
Don't ever just check it
hoping that

749
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,230
you're going to have the one
miracle high offer.

750
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,610
If that's going to happen
you'll know.

751
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,530
Because they'll just make you

752
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,720
a big offer before you can
meet them.

753
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,220
But this, this is a big
company killer.

754
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,400
And then just as a reminder to
everybody the thing that

755
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,210
kills startups at some level
is the founders giving up.

756
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,590
So sometimes you should quit.

757
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,350
But, if you mismanage your own
psychology and you quit when,

758
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,670
when you shouldn't, that, that
is what kills companies.

759
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,800
I mean that is, that is the
sort of final closet death

760
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,280
in most of these start ups.

761
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,930
And so if you can manage your
own psychology in a way that

762
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,260
you don't quit.

763
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,580
Dont go to place a where you
need to quit, or

764
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,320
give up on the startup.

765
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,760
You'll be in a far, far better
place.

766
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,570
So, marketing and PR is
something that

767
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,970
we tell companies to ignore
for a long time.

768
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,650
Everyone thinks in the early
days that the press is going

769
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,800
to be what saves them.

770
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,090
We tell them all the time it
doesn't work that way.

771
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,852
It's definitely true.

772
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:20,511
You know, press is not what's
going to save your startup.

773
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,579
But as you start to be
successful,

774
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,465
this is something that the
founders themselves need to

775
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:26,289
spend time on.

776
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,149
So, once your product is
working,

777
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:30,009
switch from not caring about
this,

778
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:31,695
to caring about it a little
bit.

779
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:33,612
And, the two most important
things for

780
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:35,776
the founder to do, the
founders to do.

781
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,920
Figure out the key messaging
yourselves.

782
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,190
Never outsource this to your
head of marketing or PR firm.

783
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,522
You, founders have to figure
out what the message of

784
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,610
the compay is going to be.

785
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,930
And once you set that, it
kind of sticks.

786
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,190
It's very hard to change this
once the press decides how

787
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,760
they're going to talk about
you.

788
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,810
The other thing is getting to
know key journalists yourself.

789
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,430
PR firms will always try to
prevent you from doing this,

790
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,080
because they need to have a
reason to exist.

791
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,990
And so they're like, well,
we're going to

792
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,310
handle the relationship with
the journalist.

793
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,050
We'll just bring you in for
interviews.

794
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,760
No journalist wants to talk to
a PR flack, ever.

795
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,260
They're so much more happy to
just hear from a founder.

796
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,460
I think the biggest PR hack
you can do,

797
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,640
is to not hire a PR firm.

798
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,450
Just pick three or four
journalists that

799
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,200
you develop really close
relationships with,

800
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,860
that like you, that understand
you, that you get.

801
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,860
And then you contact them
yourself.

802
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,070
They will cover every story
you ever give them,

803
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,650
and they'll actually pay
attention, get to know you and

804
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,140
care about the company.

805
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,100
This is so much better than
the normal strategy of having

806
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,070
a PR firm blast 200 contacts
that never read their e-mails,

807
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,980
with every piece of news.

808
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,760
so, this is something that I

809
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,060
think is important to start
doing.

810
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,420
This is also the time in

811
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,730
a company when business
development starts to matter.

812
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,460
And so, in the early days you
can

813
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,520
basically ignore anything that
would be like doing deals,

814
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,390
except maybe fund raising and
sales.

815
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,710
You know, this is the time
when they're important.

816
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,610
And everything, or many things
that you do,

817
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,800
like even fundraising, falls
under the,

818
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,044
the category of doing deals.

819
00:33:06,044 --> 00:33:07,432
So there are,

820
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:11,600
here's my one-minute crash
course on this.

821
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,130
There are five points that I

822
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,460
think are important to
understand here.

823
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,640
We've talked about this a lot.

824
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,610
Nothing will serve,

825
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,590
nothing will matter if you
don't build a great product.

826
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,640
So assume that you've done
this before you go try and

827
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,160
get anyone to do anything with
you.

828
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,680
Developing a personal
connection with anyone

829
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,000
you're trying to do any sort
of big deal with,

830
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,810
is really important.

831
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,000
For whatever reason, most
founders fail to do this, or

832
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,150
many founders fail to do this.

833
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,650
But no one wants to feel like
they're this transactional

834
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,550
thing, that you're using them
to get distribution for

835
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,660
your product, or to raise
money, or whatever.

836
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,820
And, so figuring out some way
to actually care about

837
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,370
this person and care about
what you're doing with them.

838
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,010
And not view them, you have to
in your own mind not

839
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,730
just view them as a one off
transaction.

840
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,140
You have to actually care
about them and

841
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,460
what they're going to get out
of this.

842
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,000
Competitive dynamics,

843
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,550
so this is like basic
principle of negotiation.

844
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,780
Most funders learn this the
first time in fundraising but

845
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,830
it actually matters for
everything.

846
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,170
The way you get deals done,
and

847
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,410
the way you get good terms,

848
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,140
is to have a competitive
situation.

849
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,920
You know, if you don't do this
deal with party A,

850
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,880
you're going to do it with
party B.

851
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,260
It's not always an option, but
it usually is, and this is,

852
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,770
like, the single thing that
makes deals happen and

853
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:27,500
makes deals move.

854
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,526
Tyler talked about persistence
the last lecture so

855
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:34,238
I won't hit on that again too
much, other than to say,

856
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,354
you have to go beyond your
comfort point here,

857
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:37,735
most of the time as a founder.

858
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:42,641
And then, the fifth point is
you have to ask for

859
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:43,440
what you want.

860
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,790
This is another thing, I still
have trouble with this, and

861
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,980
certainly most of the founders
we do.

862
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,800
Have, you know,

863
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,640
if you want something to deal,
just ask for it.

864
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,830
Most of the time, you know,

865
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,020
you won't get laughed out of
the room and you might get it.

866
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,700
But you have to be like,

867
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,430
at some point you actually
have to say,

868
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,220
you know this is what I'd like
you to do.

869
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,610
Even if it feels aggressive or
an overreach, or whatever.

870
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,870
So I'm going to close,

871
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,680
this part of the talk with an
image.

872
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,750
One of the Airbnb founders
drew this on

873
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,580
like a business card or

874
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,020
something for another founder
that was starting a company.

875
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,660
And then I saw it once and
took a picture of it.

876
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,510
Because I thought it was such
a good summary.

877
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,395
And what he had tried to draw
here was the Ycombinator

878
00:35:24,395 --> 00:35:26,612
process as he remembered it.

879
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,560
And I love it because it's
like so simple, and

880
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,510
it looks so do-able when it's
written on a business card.

881
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,850
But you're trying to find
product market fit.

882
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:37,820
You know, you're trying to
build a product, and

883
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,260
you're trying to close the gap
between those two gears.

884
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,170
The only way to do that is to
go off and meet the people.

885
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,880
You cannot do this without
getting really,

886
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,930
really close to your users.

887
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,465
And then he drew this graph
that,

888
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:53,395
sort of on a whiteboard at YC
and got in kind of,

889
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:57,001
like, one of the YC he writes
a passage, but that's

890
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:01,040
the graph of how adoption goes
for a new company.

891
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,140
So you launch in the press,
you get a huge spike.

892
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,940
It falls off to nothing.

893
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,670
At some point, at least one
point,

894
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,600
things look like they're
going to completely die and

895
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,680
kind of dip below the x-axis.

896
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,690
They recover a little bit.

897
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,760
You have this long, long,

898
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,310
long trough of sorrow before
things work.

899
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,800
In Airbnb's case,

900
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
it was 1,000 days before the
graph started ticking upward.
