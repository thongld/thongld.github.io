250
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQOC-qy-GDY
We launched in, you know,
less than an hour,

251
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,260
where we released a full
landing page.

252
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,750
And finally, it's okay to do
things that don't scale.

253
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,850
Doing things that don't
scale is one of your biggest

254
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,820
competitive advantages when
you're starting out.

255
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,090
And you can figure out how
to

256
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,180
scale once you have the
demand.

257
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,560
And, maybe once you've
scaled,

258
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,816
then you go get that ice
cream.

259
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,098
Thanks.

260
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:21,680
>> Sure.

261
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,927
>> How did your first
customer hear about you?

262
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:32,010
>> Yeah.
So the question was,

263
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,440
how did our first customer
hear about us?

264
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,220
Our very first one, I have
no idea.

265
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,730
We just launched
PaloAltodelivery.com.

266
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,660
We didn't do any marketing.

267
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,010
So I assume he just must
have

268
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,980
typed in Palo Alto delivery
into the web browser.

269
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,620
And then after that,

270
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,620
we didn't do, we did barely
any marketing.

271
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,000
I think I sent out like one
email to my dorm.

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,028
And that was about it.

273
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:56,680
It was all through word of
mouth and

274
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,059
that kind of just validates.

275
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,790
You know, just how strong of
a need you found.

276
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,330
You know, when people just
start talking about you and

277
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,930
they're willing to put up
with all this, you know,

278
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,710
terrible user experience,
terrible design, and

279
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,380
stuff like that.

280
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,340
>> When you started, it
seemed so obvious that you

281
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,690
were wondering why no one's
done this.

282
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,150
What's your answer now?

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,850
With that.

284
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,220
>> Yeah, I mean, looking
back, I think,

285
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,660
I think the biggest thing is
mobile.

286
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,160
The fact that now everyone
has one of

287
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,470
those in their pocket.

288
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,010
And we kinda saw that trend
and thought, you now,

289
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,330
what if you can design, you
know, a delivery system

290
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,600
that's entirely based off
mobile, where you don't have

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,590
to have any infrastructure
or delivery fleets.

292
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,470
Instead, you could, you
know,

293
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,910
instead of hiring drivers
full time,

294
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,140
purchasing vehicles, what if
you can tap into a more

295
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,170
on demand pool of
independent contractors, and

296
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,930
only send orders to them
when they have time.

297
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,630
So, that's kind of the, the
insight we had,

298
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,450
we, everything was done
through mobile.

299
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,150
Yeah.

300
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,870
>> Did you know you were
gonna be a startup, or

301
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,240
just making some money on a
website, at first?

302
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
>> Yeah, I mean, at the time
we just wanted, we're all

303
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,100
really passionate about
building technology for

304
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,110
small business owners.

305
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,850
And honestly, this delivery
things came out of

306
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,060
an experiment, right, with
the landing page.

307
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,240
Like it was literally an
experiment.

308
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,880
We didn't, we weren't
expecting anything and

309
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,350
it just took off, and we
went with it.

310
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,610
And logistics was always
something we were

311
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,820
really passionate about as
well.

312
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,940
You know like logistics,
transportation.

313
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,420
It was kind of the perfect
fusion of, you know,

314
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,550
how do you help small
business owners do delivery?

315
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,600
Back there.

316
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,160
>> Do you launch the mobile
app first or the website?

317
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,183
And how long did it take
from idea to

318
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:54,440
your first launch?

319
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,590
>> Yeah, we started with

320
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,390
this landing page right
here.

321
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,670
Took us an hour to launch.

322
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,390
>> How does DoorDash stand
out in

323
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,612
a space filled with and
other companies.

324
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:17,150
>> Yeah, the question was
how does DoorDash stand out

325
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,890
among a very competitive
space.

326
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,940
I mean, at the beginning, I
mean for us, consumer demand

327
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,080
has never been the problem,
even up until now.

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,350
So, for us it's just about,
you know, finding a need and

329
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,140
just focusing on serving
that demand.

330
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,446
So, in the beginning,
competition doesn't really

331
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,144
matter when you're getting
started.

332
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:46,579
>> Yeah, question was how
long it took for

333
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,640
us to incorporate into a
company?

334
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,451
When we went through YC.

335
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,053
So, we launched in January
2013, and

336
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,941
then we did YC that very
summer, and we, when we

337
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:58,439
decided to take this idea
through YC, we incorporated.

338
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:06,209
>> One more?

339
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,550
Yeah you.
>> What do

340
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,660
you plan to do next, or
where do you plan to go

341
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,560
with this besides like food
delivery?

342
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,490
>> Yeah I mean, the question
was where do we plan to

343
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,930
go beyond food delivery?

344
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean for us, when we
started door dash it

345
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,320
was always like I said
about.

346
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,750
Helping small business
owners and

347
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,990
figuring out, how do you
service for

348
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,530
any local merchant, whether
you are a Macaron store or

349
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,840
a restaurant or a furniture
shop.

350
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,130
I mean, that's still our
focus,

351
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,360
that's like the long-term
vision.

352
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,870
For now we're just focused
on rush on

353
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,240
delivery as a way to scale,
but

354
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,256
ultimately that's where we
want it end up in.

355
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:45,952
>> Cool.

356
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:46,988
>> Thanks.

357
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:57,388
>> Okay, next is Walker
Williams from Teespring,

358
00:15:57,388 --> 00:16:00,222
Teespring at the YC, you're
in Africa?

359
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,530
>> Yeah.
>> I almost rejected them.

360
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,030
Sounds like a dumb idea but

361
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,980
now they're doing hundreds
of millions of

362
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,450
dollars a year of revenue so
very lucky to have him.

363
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,355
And Walker's gonna talk also

364
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:12,520
about doing things
non-scale.

365
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,500
>> All right.

366
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,980
Thank you guys for having
me.

367
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,000
My name is Walker.

368
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,620
I'm the CEO and founder of
Teespring, for

369
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,156
those of you guys who don't
know what Teespring is.

370
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:26,160
We're an e-commerce platform
that allows entrepreneurs to

371
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,850
launch products and

372
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,830
apparel brands without
risks, costs or compromise.

373
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,680
Today the company is about
180 folks and

374
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,460
we ship tens of thousands of
products each day,

375
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,720
and I wanna talk to you
about one of the most

376
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,135
fundamental advantages you
have as a start-up and

377
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:48,020
that's you're able to do
things that don't scale, and

378
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,410
I define things that don't
scale as things that

379
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,420
are sort of fundamentally
unsustainable.

380
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,380
They will not last,

381
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,200
they will not bring in the
millionth user and

382
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,400
where they break, it's
usually time, but

383
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,670
it could be a number of
other things.

384
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,480
But it's really growth

385
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,130
strategies that won't take
you to a million users and

386
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,450
there's three real places I
wanna focus on today.

387
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,820
First one is finding your
first users.

388
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,090
The second one is turning
those users into champions,

389
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,460
and the third one is finding
your product and market fit.

390
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,050
So finding your first users,
the first thing you have to

391
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,790
understand is that there is
no silver bullet for

392
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,670
user acquisition.

393
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,280
Everybody and this includes
me when we got started,

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,400
you look for that, that
dream solution,

395
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,330
that pay-per-click campaign
that has tremendous ROI.

396
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,200
Some accelerating
partnership that's gonna

397
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,030
springboard you into the
stratosphere, an affiliate

398
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,490
agreement, something that
solves it for you.

399
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,810
But the reality is for

400
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,240
the vast majority of
companies and

401
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,110
in fact, for every company
that I've had the chance to

402
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,900
speak to CEO of, that's just
not possible.

403
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,290
Those are unicorns and

404
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,620
most of the companies that
from the outside look

405
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,260
like they've had this dream
growth curve.

406
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,810
The reality is that those
first users were impossibly

407
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,485
hard to get and let me tell
you about

408
00:18:04,485 --> 00:18:08,280
the story of a ridiculously
unsustainable business.

409
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,490
So, this is teespring in
2012.

410
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,070
When we first got, when we
first launched the business

411
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,270
couldn't have looked worse
it took days of meetings.

412
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,330
We had to offer free design
and

413
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,000
days of revisions back and
forth.

414
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,870
We'd have to launch the
product ourselves.

415
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,770
We'd have to do the social
media.

416
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,124
All the sell like 50 shirts
for a local non-profit, and

417
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,247
generate $1,000 of revenue,

418
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,880
anybody looking in would
have said.

419
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,330
You guys need to give up,
this is a terrible idea.

420
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,450
But as time went on, those
users started to

421
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,100
add up and I think something
you have to

422
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,940
understand is that when you
first launch a company,

423
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,900
just by virtue of the fact
that it's a new product,

424
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,570
you're gonna be bad at
selling it, right?

425
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,610
You've got no idea what the
paying points of customers

426
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,260
really are.

427
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,550
You've never sold it before.

428
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,610
You don't have any success
stories to point to or

429
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,880
testimonials.

430
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,650
Those first users are always
going to be the hardest, and

431
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,660
so it's your responsibility
as a founder to do

432
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,290
whatever it takes to bring
in your first users and

433
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,548
it's gonna be different for
every company.

434
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:18,110
The common thread that I
hear is founders need to

435
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,890
spend personal time and
effort.

436
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,320
A lot of their personal time
and

437
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,675
effort to bring those users
in themselves,

438
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:25,900
it can mean a number of
thing.

439
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,830
Everything from sending 100
emails a day, getting on

440
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,770
the phone and just calling
as many people as you can,

441
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,870
going through a network,

442
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,150
if you have a network like
Standford or Y Combinator.

443
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,820
Anything you can do to get
that first user and I really

444
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,730
equate it to pushing a
boulder up a hill and

445
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,820
if you think of like a very
sort of smooth hill,

446
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,010
when you get started.

447
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,380
The incline is the steepest
in those first inches are

448
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,770
the hardest and over time as
you get farther and farther.

449
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,020
The incline stays out, it
gets easier and

450
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,220
hopefully, eventually you
reached a point where you're

451
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,280
at the top of the hill and
the boulder starts to

452
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,710
roll on its own, and so
those first users,

453
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,330
you just cannot focus on ROI
in the sense of time.

454
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,880
Do not expect to spend an
hour and

455
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,230
return thousands of dollars.

456
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,190
Maybe Stanley is one of
those unicorns that was

457
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,560
a pretty incredible story.

458
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,090
But for most of us those
first users

459
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,910
are going to take a lot of a
hand holding, a lot of

460
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,450
personal love and that's
okay, that's essential for

461
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,150
building a company, and the
one sort of caveat of that

462
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,670
is that I don't recommend
giving away your product for

463
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,460
free and there's plenty of
exceptions to this rule.

464
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,270
But in general cutting costs
or giving the product away

465
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,730
is an unsustainable strategy
I wouldn't recommend.

466
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,040
You need to make sure that
users value your product and

467
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,990
people have a different,
they treat products that

468
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,910
are free in a much different
way than a paid product and

469
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,980
often times it can give you
a false sense of security if

470
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,620
oh, we're getting all these
users surely we

471
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,810
can convert them over to
paid.

472
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,580
The second aspect is what
happens when you get those

473
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
users, how do you turn those
users into champions and

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,870
a champion is a user who
talks about and

475
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,540
advocates for your product.

476
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,050
And I'm a firm believer that
every company with a great

477
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,950
growth strategy has users
who are champions and so

478
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,370
really the easiest way to
build.

479
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,180
Turn a user in to a champion
is to delight them with

480
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,910
an experience their gonna
remember so

481
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,920
something that's unusual or

482
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,970
out of the ordinary an
exceptional experience and

483
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,290
the easiest way to do this
early and

484
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,570
again something that is
completely unsustainable,

485
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,140
it's not gonna scale forever
is to just talk to

486
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,450
those users and people will
say this all the time,

487
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:46,960
and you hear it.

488
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,775
It's one of the sort of core
tenants of why

489
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,740
combinators talk to users
but I cannot stress

490
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,620
how important it is that you
spend a large chunk of your

491
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,400
time talking to users, and
you should do it constantly,

492
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,800
every single day and as long
as possible.

493
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Today at Teespring,

494
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm still the catch all
email address, so

495
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,400
anytime somebody misspells
support or writes an email

496
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,030
address that doesn't exist,
I get that email, and so

497
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,770
I still do about 12 to 20
customer service tickets

498
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,910
every single day.
