778
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:30,030
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno
he's got some really good
creative tips in there.

779
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,023
>> Like the, the guy's been
dead 20 years and I think he

780
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:35,951
still, I, I buy everyone on
my team gets both of these

781
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:38,406
books when they start on my
team.

782
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:39,470
So virality.

783
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,450
So Sean Park has this model
that he taught or he

784
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,530
told us about when he, when,
when I joined Facebook.

785
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,560
Which is to think about
virality for

786
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,610
a product in terms of three
things.

787
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,650
First is payload.

788
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,390
So how many people can you
hit with any

789
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,326
given viral blast?

790
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,702
Second, he had cooler words
for

791
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,841
these, I'm not quite as
cool.

792
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:13,100
Second is conversion rate,
and third is frequency.

793
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,230
Payload frequency and

794
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,480
conversion rate, whatever,
that order.

795
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,640
So, how many people can you
hit at once is payload.

796
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,890
How many times can you hit
them per blast is frequency.

797
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,130
And what are they gonna
convert at?

798
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,180
And that gives you

799
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,870
a fundamental idea of how
viral a product is.

800
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,074
So Hotmail is like, the
canonical example of

801
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,730
brilliant viral marketing,
right?

802
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,840
Back when Hotmail launched,

803
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,000
there were a bunch of mail
companies that had

804
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,320
been funded and they were
throwing huge amounts of

805
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,170
money at traditional
advertising.

806
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,570
How many people know the
Hotmail story, of virality?

807
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,570
Awesome, great, new
audience, sorry.

808
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,859
Those two or three people
will be bored.

809
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,161
But Hotmail back in, back at
that time.

810
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,923
People couldn't get free
email clients,

811
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,000
they had to be tied to their
ISP.

812
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,650
And Hotmail and a few other
companies launched and

813
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,550
their clients were available
wherever you went.

814
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,410
You could log in via library
internet or whatever,

815
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,690
school internet, and be able
to get access to that.

816
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,140
Which was a really big value
proposition for

817
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,050
everyone, who wanted to
access it.

818
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,770
Most of the companies, went
out there and

819
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,760
did big TV campaigns and
billboard campaigns and

820
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,740
newspaper campaigns and

821
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,050
things like that forced a
lot of advertising of Yahoo,

822
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,320
all of those things.

823
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,040
But the Hotmail team didn't
have as much funding, and so

824
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,440
they had to scrabble around
to figure out how to do it.

825
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,050
So, what they did was add
that little link at

826
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,390
the bottom of every email
that said,

827
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,090
sent from Hotmail, get your
free email here.

828
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, the interesting thing
is that meant

829
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
the payload was low.

830
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,580
Right, you email one person
at a time,

831
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,740
not necessarily gonna have a
huge payload.

832
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,710
Maybe you send around some
of those viral spam emails.

833
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,170
But then I'm not sure I'll
click on your link.

834
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,090
The frequency is high,
though because you're

835
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,680
emailing the same people
over and over and over.

836
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,060
Which means you're gonna hit
them once,

837
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,130
twice, three times a day
with that same link and

838
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,260
really move up the
impressions.

839
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,290
And the conversion rate was
also very high because

840
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,370
people didn't like being
tied to their ISP email.

841
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,020
And so Hotmail ended up
being

842
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,540
extremely viral because it
had high frequency and

843
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,420
high conversion rates.

844
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,690
Another example is PayPal.

845
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,880
PayPal, PayPal is
interesting because PayPal

846
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,490
has two sites to it.

847
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,320
PayPal has the buyer and the
seller site.

848
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,190
The other thing that's
interesting about PayPal is

849
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,050
its mechanism for viral
growth was eBay.

850
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,670
And so you can use all kinds
of things for

851
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,090
virality that may not look
necessarily obviously viral.

852
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,640
So PayPal, if you sent
money,

853
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,290
if you said to a seller, I
am going to send you money.

854
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,800
Like, I can't think of a
higher conversion rate.

855
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,360
Frequency was low, payload
was low, but

856
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,110
PayPal did this thing, where
they gave away money when

857
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,840
you got your friends to sign
up for PayPal, and

858
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,180
so that's how they went
viral on the consumer side.

859
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,380
They didn't have to do that
for sellers,

860
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,080
because if I said I'm gonna
send you money via this,

861
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,750
you will take that.

862
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,400
And even on the consumer
side they

863
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,990
went viral because someone
said sign up for

864
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,610
this thing and you'll get 10
bucks.

865
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,640
Why wouldn't you?

866
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,260
So, they were able to go
viral, but

867
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,410
in both cases it was because
their conversion rate was

868
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,030
incredibly high on the buyer
and the seller side.

869
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,720
No.

870
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,030
Because their payload and
frequency was high.

871
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,560
Makes sense?

872
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,440
So this is a really good way
to look at virality if

873
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,560
you wanna say, is this
product viral?

874
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,340
Facebook was not viral via
email sharing or

875
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,700
anything like that.

876
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,180
Facebook was purely viral by
a word of mouth.

877
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,580
Because the interesting
thing about PayPal and

878
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,770
Hotmail Is to use them the
first person had to

879
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,980
send an email to someone who
wasn't on the service.

880
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,890
With Facebook there's no

881
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,250
native way to contact people
who aren't on the service.

882
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,680
Everyone thinks of Facebook
as viral marketing success,

883
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,130
and that's actually, not how
it grew.

884
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,130
It was word of mouth
virality, because it was an

885
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,110
awesome product you wanted
to tell your friends about.

886
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,860
How's everyone doing?

887
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,770
Is this interesting?

888
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,505
Great, question, yes.

889
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
>> So when you're talking
about this low pay

890
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
load in both of the
examples.

891
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,330
In the later rounds as this
sort of campaign or

892
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,480
whatever you want to call it
gets going.

893
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,542
Aren't you going to have a
much higher pay load as

894
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:11,806
more and more people are
sending Hotmail] to more and

895
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,818
more folks, and that way
your pay load grows and

896
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,090
grows and grows?

897
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,610
So, the question is in the
first round it

898
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,170
makes sense that it has a
low pay load, but

899
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,640
in later rounds, aren't you
gonna have higher pay

900
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,410
loads as people send more
and more and more emails.

901
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,760
I guess in my head, well,
first and

902
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,170
foremost, I think you
actually,

903
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,200
only send emails to a small
number of people.

904
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,640
So, compared to like the
massive viral engines that

905
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,210
exist today,

906
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,370
where you import someone's
entire contact book.

907
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,690
And send them all.

908
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,810
Send them all an email, or

909
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,490
where you post to everyone's
friends on Facebook.

910
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,280
The actual payloads are
still very small.

911
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,350
Even if it's everyone that

912
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,700
you email on a frequent
basis you hit.

913
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm also thinking really per
email sent out.

914
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,290
How many people are on it?

915
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,640
But it's a fair point, like
yeah, as more people get on,

916
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,260
get on Hotmail they'll send
more emails,

917
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,560
as more people use email.

918
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,670
The product actually, grows
more and more successfully.

919
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,770
So, that's a fair point.

920
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,370
Go for it.

921
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,480
>> Doesn't, like, point of
conversion also matter?

922
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,990
So, like, when just click
and sign up.

923
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,399
But if you skip the goal ad
it's

924
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,490
>> Completely agree,

925
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,060
that's why, oh I'm sorry.

926
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,850
Doesn't point to conversion
matters as well, so

927
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,800
on Hotmail, you click to
sign up, but on a billboard

928
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,830
you have to remember that
the URL goes to the website,

929
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,470
type it in, find the
registration button,

930
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,620
click register and sign up.

931
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,380
Yes.

932
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,570
Yes, anything you can do to
move friction out of

933
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,690
the flow.

934
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,420
And going from an offline ad
to an online ad removes huge

935
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,920
amounts of frictions from
the flow.

936
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,630
Obviously.

937
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,740
Totally agree with that.

938
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,315
One more at the back.

939
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion related?

940
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,280
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

941
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,170
Absolutely.

942
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,870
If you hit someone with the
same promotion,

943
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,940
I repeated that.

944
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

945
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,590
If you hit someone with the
same email over and over and

946
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,500
over again.

947
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,300
All the same banner ads,
this is one of the things

948
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,520
that's fundamental about
online marketing.

949
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,280
The same rules apply to
every channel.

950
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,600
If you hit someone with the
same Facebook ad over, and

951
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,280
over, and over, the more
times you

952
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,700
hit them with the same ad
the less they'll click.

953
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,250
That's why we have creative
exhaustion you have to

954
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,990
rotate creatives on
Facebook.

955
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,230
Same with banner ads, same
with news feed stories.

956
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,360
The fiftieth time you see
the IQ story in

957
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,110
your news feed, you are not
gonna click on it.

958
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,500
If you haven't clicked on
the 49 before,

959
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,700
you're not gonna click on
the 50th.

960
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,560
The same is absolutely true
with these emails.

961
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,530
So, if you send the same
email over and

962
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,300
over and over to people for
an invite.

963
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
Or if you send the same
little link at

964
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,730
the bottom over and over and
over to people for Hotmail.

965
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,630
Or I mean the PayPal one's

966
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,240
different because people
just signed up.

967
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,370
But yes, you will get lower
conversion rate.

968
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,160
And the more you hit someone
with

969
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,100
the same message the less
they convert.

970
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,010
Is fundamental across every
online marketing channel,

971
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,290
every online marketing
channel, cool.

972
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,670
Second way, to look at
virality,

973
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,120
which I think is awesome, is
by this guy Ed.

974
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,950
And Ed runs the growth team
at Uber now,

975
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,230
he was at the growth team at
Facebook.

976
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,870
And he was a Stanford MBA
student, and

977
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,410
did a class similar to this,

978
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,460
where they talked about
virility.

979
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,420
And they all went and built
viral products.

980
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,200
And there was a bunch of
press about that actually.

981
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,950
And these brilliance of
these stuff.

982
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,900
The interesting thing about
Uber.

983
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,800
If you look at there growth
team

984
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,160
they're incredibly focused
on drivers.

985
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,750
Because it's a two

986
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,530
sided market place they need
drivers.

987
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,210
That's a huge, huge chunk of
their focus as a team.

988
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,990
Even they've got like
probably the best viral guy

989
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,060
in the world at the company.

990
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,260
So, with virality,

991
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,870
you get someone to contact
import, let's say.

992
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,140
Then the question is,

993
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,970
how many of those people do
you get to send imports?

994
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,630
Then the question is, to how
many people?

995
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,120
Then, how many click?

996
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,730
And you can put extra steps
in this.

997
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,170
You could put how many open,
how many click, whatever.

998
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,410
How many click, how many
sign up.

999
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,390
And then how many of those
import.

1000
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,140
So essentially, you want
people who sign up to

1001
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,270
your site, to import their
contacts.

1002
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,590
You want to then get them to
send an invite to all of

1003
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,850
those contacts.

1004
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,350
You want to get.

1005
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,490
It to all of those contacts,
not just one of them.

1006
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,920
Then you want to get a
percentage of those to

1007
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,960
click, and a percentage of
those to sign up.

1008
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,330
If you multiply out the
percents at every point in

1009
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,150
this, this is essentially,

1010
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,340
where well this isn't a
percent, this is a number.

1011
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,470
If you multiply those out,

1012
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,680
that's essentially, the
point where you

1013
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,010
get to the question of what
is the k factor.

1014
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,670
So, if you have, when
someone imports if on

1015
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,708
average they send invites to
100 people.

1016
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:24,790
Sorry doing that wrong,
let's say 100

1017
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,970
people get an invite per
person who imports.

1018
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,039
And then of those 10% click.

1019
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,930
That gets you to 10.

1020
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,370
And then, of those, let's
say, 50% sign up.

1021
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,920
That gets you to 5.

1022
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,648
And then, of those,

1023
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:43,090
only 10 to 20% actually,
subsequently import.

1024
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,360
You're gonna be at a point
where you're at 0.5 to 1 as

1025
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,700
your K factor.

1026
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,400
And you're gonna not be
viral.

1027
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,270
So, a lot of things like
Vidi are very good at

1028
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,070
pumping, or were very good
at pumping out stories.

1029
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,210
They got the cave factor
over one, and it's perfectly

1030
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,450
doable to get the cave
factor over one, but

1031
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,320
if you have something that
doesn't have high retention

1032
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,620
on the back end then it
doesn't really matter.

1033
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,840
So, you should look at your
invite flow and

1034
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,999
say, what is my equivalent
import?

1035
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,330
How many people, per import,
are invites sent to?

1036
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,320
How many of those receive
clicks?
