1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,431
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ
That short.

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:07,280
Like, long introductions are
no good.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,730
Sam knows.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,290
Alright, ready, everybody?

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,290
I'm not gonna ask if the mic
is working like in

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,710
every talk so far.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,558
I'll just assume it's
working.

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:18,150
>> No!

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,920
>> No, fuck!

10
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,080
>> All right, well make it
work somebody.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,108
>> It works, it works

12
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,436
>> All right, this is like
some kinda class tradition.

13
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:31,043
All right, all right.

14
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:32,483
I wrote out my talk and

15
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:35,523
afterwards in a couple days
I will like turn it

16
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:38,410
from a talk into an essay
and put it online.

17
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,850
So, you don't have to take
notes, just, just listen.

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,960
All right.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,912
So, one of the advantages of
having kids is

20
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,187
that when you have to give
advice to people,

21
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:50,906
you can ask yourself, what
would I tell my own kids?

22
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:54,270
And actually, you find this
really focuses you.

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,963
So, even though my kids are
little.

24
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:58,239
My two year old today,

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,405
when I asked what he was
gonna be after two?

26
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,006
He said a bat.

27
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,710
The correct answer was
three.

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,040
But a bat is so much more
interesting.

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,480
So even though my kids are
little,

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,310
I already know what I would
tell them about startups if

31
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,510
they were in college.

32
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,485
And so that is what I am
gonna tell you.

33
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:16,670
So, you're literally getting
what I

34
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,470
would give my own kids,

35
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,002
since most of you are young
enough to be my own kids.

36
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:22,864
All right.
So,

37
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,963
startups are very
counterintuitive.

38
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,705
And I'm not sure exactly
why,

39
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:30,787
it could be simply because
knowledge about them has not

40
00:01:30,787 --> 00:01:32,730
permeated our culture yet.

41
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,390
But, whatever the reason,
this is an area where you

42
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,240
cannot trust you're
intuitions all the time.

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,010
It's like skiing in that
way.

44
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,730
Any of you guys learn to ski
as adults?

45
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,730
You know, when you're
skiing,

46
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,790
when you first try skiing
and you want to slow down,

47
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,680
your first impulse is to
lean back,

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,690
just like in everything
else,

49
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,350
but lean back on skis and

50
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,600
you fly down the hill out of
control, so, as I learned.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,380
So, part of learning to ski
is learning to

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,920
suppress that impulse.

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,340
Eventually, you get new
habits.

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,880
But in the beginning there's
this list of things you're

55
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,560
trying to remember as you
start down the hill.

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,800
You know, like alternate
feet, make s-turns,

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,182
do not drag the inside foot,
all this stuff.

58
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:14,270
Well, startups are as
unnatural as

59
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,090
skiing and there is a
similar list of stuff you

60
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,910
have to remember for
startups.

61
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,690
And what Iâ€™m gonna give you
today is the beginning of

62
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,540
the list.

63
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,480
The list of the
counterintuitive stuff you

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,000
have to remember to like
prevent your

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,970
existing instincts from
leading you astray.

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,860
The first thing on it, is
the fact that I just

67
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,890
mentioned that startups are
so weird that if you

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,811
follow your instincts they
will lead you astray.

69
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:40,033
If you remember nothing more
than that.

70
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,322
When you're about to make a
mistake,

71
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:45,660
you may at least pause
before making it.

72
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,990
When I was running Y
Combinator,

73
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,780
we used to joke that our
function was to tell

74
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,440
founders things they would
ignore.

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,780
And it's really true.

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,180
Batch after batch, the YC
partners warn founders about

77
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,390
mistakes they are about to
make.

78
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,170
And the founders ignore
them.

79
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,500
And they come back a year
later and

80
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,550
say, I wish we'd listened.

81
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,390
But, that dude is in their
cap table and

82
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,820
there's nothing they can do.

83
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,590
Why do founders persistently
ignore the partner's advice?

84
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,642
Well, that's the thing about
counterintuitive ideas, they

85
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:21,939
contradict your intuitions,
so they seem wrong.

86
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,620
So, of course you're first
impulse is to ignore them.

87
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,990
And in fact that is not just
the curse of Y Combinator,

88
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,470
but to some extent our You
don't need people to

89
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,140
give you advice that doesn't
surprise you, right?

90
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,290
If founder's existing
intuitions gave them

91
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,320
the right answers they
wouldn't need us.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,350
That's why there are a lot
of ski instructors and

93
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,450
not a lot of running
instructors.

94
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,987
You don't see those two
words together,

95
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:50,952
running instructor, as much
as you see ski instructor.

96
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:53,468
It's because skiing is
counterintuitive.

97
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,551
So sorta, what YC is,

98
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:59,833
is like business ski
instructors, except for

99
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:03,693
going up the slopes instead
of down them.

100
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,898
Well, ideally,

101
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:11,750
you can however trust your
instincts about people.

102
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,790
You, your life so far hasn't
been much like

103
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,650
starting a startup, but all
the interactions you've had

104
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,660
with people are just like
the interactions you've had

105
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,110
with people in the business
world.

106
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,920
So, in fact one of

107
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,320
the big mistakes that
founders make is to not

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,340
trust their intuitions about
people enough.

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,380
They meet someone who seems
impressive, but

110
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,686
about whom they feel some
misgivings.

111
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:33,097
And then later, when things
blow up,

112
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,573
they tell themselves, they
say, you know,

113
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,310
I knew there was something
wrong about that guy, but

114
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,867
I ignored it because he
seemed so impressive.

115
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:43,782
And there's a specific
sub-case in business,

116
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:47,193
especially if you come from
an engineering background as

117
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,481
I believe you all do.

118
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,463
You think business is
supposed to be

119
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:53,095
this sorta slightly
distasteful thing.

120
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,531
And so when you meet people
who seem smart, but

121
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,387
somehow distasteful you
think well,

122
00:04:57,387 --> 00:04:59,306
okay this must be normal for
business.

123
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,725
But it's not.

124
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,618
Just like pick people the
way you would pick people if

125
00:05:03,618 --> 00:05:05,140
you were picking friends.

126
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,880
This is one of those rare
cases where it

127
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,660
works to be self indulgent.

128
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,017
Work with people you
genuinely like and respect

129
00:05:13,017 --> 00:05:15,861
and that you have known long
enough to be sure.

130
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,491
Because there's a lot of
people who

131
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,730
are really good at seeming
likeable for a while.

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,209
Just wait till your
interests are opposed and

133
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:22,791
then you'll see.

134
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,148
All right.

135
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:28,897
The second counterintuitive
point is that, and this

136
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:32,739
will, might come as a little
bit of a disappointment.

137
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:36,068
But what you need to succeed
in a startup is

138
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:39,140
not expertise in startups.

139
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,560
That makes this class
different from most other

140
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,820
classes you take.

141
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,990
You take a French class at
the end of it you will

142
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,890
learn how to speak French if
you do the work.

143
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,950
You may not sound exactly
like a French person,

144
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,300
but pretty close, right?

145
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,650
This class can teach you
about startups but

146
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,410
that is not what you need to
know.

147
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,150
What you need to know
to suceed in a startup is not

148
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,930
expertise in startups,

149
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,160
what you need is expertise
in your own users.

150
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,280
Mark Zuckerberg did not
succeed in

151
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,900
Facebook because he was an
expert in startups.

152
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,070
He succeeded despite being a
complete noob at startups.

153
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,860
I mean, Facebook was

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,260
first incorporated as a
Florida LLC.

155
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,060
Even you guys know better
than that.

156
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,840
He succeeded despite being a
complete noob at startups

157
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,620
because he understood his
users very well.

158
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,130
Most of you don't know the
mechanics of

159
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,377
raising an Angel round.

160
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:38,556
Right, and if you feel bad
about that, don't, because I

161
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,481
can tell you Mark Zuckerberg
probably doesn't know

162
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:44,164
the mechanics of raising an
Angel round either.

163
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:47,186
If he was even paying
attention when Ron Conway

164
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:48,811
wrote him the big check,

165
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:51,611
he has probably forgotten
about it by now.

166
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,845
In fact, I worry, it's not
merely unnecessary for

167
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:57,485
people to learn in detail
about the mechanics of

168
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,659
starting a startup, but
possibly somewhat dangerous.

169
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,748
Because another of the
characteristic mistakes of

170
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:06,764
young founders starting
startups is to go through

171
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:08,960
the motions of starting a
startup.

172
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,500
They come up with some
plausible sounding idea.

173
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,140
They raise funding at a nice
valuation.

174
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,660
They rent a nice office in
Soma,

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,590
hire a bunch of their
friends.

176
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,020
And then the next step,
after rent a nice

177
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,600
office in Soma and hire a
bunch of their friends,

178
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,160
is gradually realize how
completely fucked they are.

179
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,230
Because while imitating all
the outward forms of

180
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,560
starting a startup,

181
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,590
they have neglected the one
thing that's actually

182
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,190
essential which is to make
something people want.

183
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,500
By the way, that's the only
use of that swear word

184
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,670
except for the initial one
that was involuntary.

185
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,876
And I did check with Sam
whether it would be okay.

186
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:52,035
He said he had done it
several times.

187
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,072
I mean, used the word.

188
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,085
>> We saw this happen so
often, No, I mean people

189
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,041
going through the motions of
starting a startup.

190
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,180
>> That we made up a name
for it.

191
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,080
Playing house.

192
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,720
Eventually, I realized why
it was happening.

193
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,230
The reason young founders go
through the motions of

194
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,710
starting a startup is

195
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,590
because that is what they
have been trained to do for

196
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,250
their whole lives up to this
point.

197
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,097
Think about what it takes to
get into college.

198
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:35,595
Extracurricular activities,
check.

199
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:36,745
Right?

200
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:40,385
Even in college classes,
most of the work you do is

201
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,735
as artificial as running
laps.

202
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,741
And I am not attacking the
educational system for

203
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,771
being this way.

204
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,728
Inevitably, the work that
you do to learn something is

205
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,988
gonna have some amount of
fakeness to it.

206
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,441
And if you measure people's
performance,

207
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,884
they will inevitably exploit
the difference.

208
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:59,333
To the degree that what
you're measuring is

209
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,500
largely an artifact of the
fakeness.

210
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,880
And I confess that I did
this myself in college.

211
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,700
In fact, here is a useful
tip on getting good grades.

212
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,215
I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be

213
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,911
20 or 30 ideas that
actually,

214
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,606
had the right shape to make
good exam questions.

215
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:17,818
And so the way I studied for
exams in these classes was

216
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:20,302
not to master the material
in the class.

217
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:20,903
But to try and

218
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:23,038
figure out what the exam
questions would be and

219
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,583
work out the answers in
advance.

220
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:27,283
Unlike, for me the test was
not like what my

221
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,160
answers would be on the
exam.

222
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
For me the test was.

223
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,230
Which of my exam questions
would turn up

224
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,930
on the exam, right?

225
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,100
So I would get my grade
instantly.

226
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,280
I would walk into the exam
and

227
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
look at the questions and

228
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,060
see how many I got right
essentially.

229
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,610
>> It works in a lot of
classes,

230
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,926
especially CS classes.

231
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,636
I remember Automata Theory,
there's only a few

232
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,620
things that make sense to
ask about Automata Theory.

233
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,494
So, it's not surprising that
after being effectively

234
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,061
trained for their whole
lives to play such games,

235
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,934
young founders first impulse
upon starting a startup is

236
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,722
to figure out what the
tricks are.

237
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:02,741
For this new game,

238
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,673
what are the extracurricular
activities of startups,

239
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,820
what are the things that I
have to do.

240
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,789
They always wanna know
since,

241
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,591
since apparently the measure
of success for

242
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:16,104
a startup is fundraisingn
another noob mistake.

243
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:18,494
They always wanna know, what
are the tricks for

244
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,754
convincing investors.

245
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,214
And we have to tell them,

246
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,372
the best way to convince
investors,

247
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,989
is to start a startup that's
actually doing well, meaning

248
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:29,997
growing fast, and then
simply tell investors so.

249
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,385
So then they ask, okay, what
are the tricks for

250
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:33,170
growing fast?

251
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,830
Alright?
And

252
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,960
this is exacerbated by the
existence of this term,

253
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
growth hacks.

254
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,830
Right?

255
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,270
Whenever you hear anybody
talk about growth hacks,

256
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,790
just mentally translate it
in your mind to bullshit.

257
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,630
Because what we tell them is
the way to make your startup

258
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,925
grow is to make something
that users really love.

259
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,530
Right, and then tell them
about it.

260
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,690
So that's what you have to
do.

261
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,869
That is growth hacks right
there.

262
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,963
So many of the conversations
the YC partners have with

263
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,128
the founders begin with the
founders saying a sentence

264
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,791
that begins with, how do I.

265
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,780
And the partner is answering
with a sentence that begins

266
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,550
with, just.

267
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,346
Right, why do they make
things so complicated?

268
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,386
The reason, I realized,

269
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,050
after years of being puzzled
by this,

270
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,610
is they're looking for the
trick,

271
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,598
they've been trained to look
for the trick.

272
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,360
So, this is the third thing.

273
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,082
The third counterintuitive
thing to

274
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:28,189
remember about startups.

275
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,454
Starting a startup is

276
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,850
where gaming the system
stops working.

277
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,741
Gaming the system may
continue to work if you go

278
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,980
to work for a big company.

279
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,750
Depending on how broken the
company is you may be able

280
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,410
to succeed by sucking up to
the right person.

281
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,690
Giving the impression of
productivity by sending

282
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,030
emails late at night.

283
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,274
Or if your smart enough,

284
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,172
changing the clock on your
computer,

285
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:54,212
cause whose going to check
the headers, right?

286
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:59,907
But, I like an audience I
tell jokes like that to and

287
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,222
they laugh.

288
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:06,511
Over in the business school,
headers, okay.

289
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:10,327
God this thing is being
recorded,

290
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:13,002
I just realized that.

291
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,085
All right, from now on,

292
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,818
we are sticking strictly to
the script.

293
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:21,172
>> All right.

294
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:23,770
But in startups, that does
not work.

295
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,050
There is no boss to trick.

296
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,400
There's no, how can you
trick people if

297
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,050
there's no one to trick?
