296
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,360
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVhTvQXfibU
Because, it's,

297
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,790
like, well, I don't want,
like, a lot of formalities.

298
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,030
I don't want a lot of process.

299
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,270
I want it to be organic.

300
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,280
We want to do yoga.

301
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:23,862
>>
>> We want to

302
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:25,801
only smoke organic weed.

303
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:30,586
Sorry that was like a Peter.

304
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:33,988
Peter got very focused on

305
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:40,643
who was smokin' weed a little
while ago.

306
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:45,114
But like, the process actually
protects it

307
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:50,238
protects the culture because
what it does it says look,

308
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:53,850
we're going to look at all the
inputs.

309
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,250
We're going to have a formal
way of saying anybody who

310
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,890
wants a raise come talk to me.

311
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,430
Like, I'm not going to give
you a raise, but

312
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,750
I'm happy to hear your story.

313
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm going to talk to all the
people you work with so

314
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,750
I get like a, understanding of
it.

315
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,664
I'm going to evaluate all the
work that you've done so

316
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,909
I know like, where I actually
rate you, and

317
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,560
what my actual opinion on
them.

318
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,734
I'm going to do that
periodically,

319
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,420
I'm not going to do it daily.

320
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,100
But like yeah, maybe if I were
fast moving I'll do it

321
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,540
ever six months or even maybe
once a quarter.

322
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,870
And at the end of that process
I

323
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,850
will tell you want your raise
is.

324
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,490
And I will tell you if you're
getting one of if you're not

325
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,870
getting one, but I'm not
going to do things off cycle.

326
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,772
I'm not going to do things
when asked.

327
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,949
There's like one process, and
that's it.

328
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:37,980
And I, you know, when I used
to be CEO, and

329
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,635
I had, like, executive, it's
the bigger this gets,

330
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,386
the harder this gets because
the more

331
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:45,090
aggressive the people working
for you are.

332
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,000
Because to get to be an
executive, it turns out,

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,720
you often have to be pretty
aggressive in this world.

334
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,790
And in most companies, like,

335
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,050
that's how you get to that
level.

336
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,400
You know, I would go, like,
you can lobby me all you want,

337
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,710
you know, after the process is
done, and

338
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,960
I give you your raise, but you
know what?

339
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm not hearing it,

340
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,620
because I already went through
my process.

341
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,730
I got your input going in.

342
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,160
I got everybody else's input,
I've got so many people,

343
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,060
I've got so much money and you
got what I believe is right.

344
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,217
And having a process like that
basically gets people to be

345
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,391
actually more comfortable.

346
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:22,683
They're more comfortable
because they don't always have

347
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,760
to be on edge about like am I
asking for what I deserve?

348
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,166
Or am I getting like aced out
because of who I am,

349
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,069
what I look like,

350
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,090
I'm not buddy buddy, I'm not
at the golf course with you.

351
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,060
Or I'm not doing whatever you
like to do.

352
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,330
Or, you know?

353
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,815
I don't have to worry about
any of that.

354
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:36,880
'because I know your process.

355
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,770
I know your processes like
you're going to evaluate

356
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,410
everybody, and then you're
going to give 'em what's fair.

357
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,710
And so that's a, a much better
way to handle that.

358
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,770
And it means that you're
actually understanding what

359
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,860
everybody thinks.

360
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,490
Not just the people you're
talking to at the moment.

361
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,588
Okay, so now we're going to
get into some fun stuff.

362
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:56,290
We're going to evaluate Sam's
blog post, how.

363
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,151
Which is actually, there are
some very good things in it.

364
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,855
And then there are some things
I'm going to discuss.

365
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:03,736
>>
>> So Sam, so

366
00:16:03,736 --> 00:16:06,222
this is the expert, excerpt.

367
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:09,813
Most employees have nine, only
90 days after they leave a job

368
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:11,450
to exercise their options.

369
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,000
Unfortunately, this requires
money to

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,850
cover the strike price and the
tax bill.

371
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,570
I'll explain this a little
later, just.

372
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,550
But I want to read it first.

373
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,249
For the year of exercise,
blah, blah, blah,

374
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,821
this is often more cash than
an employee has.

375
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,060
And this is the key.

376
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,002
And so the employee has to
choose between like, leaving

377
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:32,132
the job and walking away from
the invested options of either

378
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:35,200
money that she has because she
can't afford to exercise or

379
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,330
being like locked into staying
at the company basically for

380
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,660
all the wrong reasons.

381
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,699
So particularly bad

382
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,143
situation when an employee
gets terminated and

383
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,782
I'll get into that and that's
a really key point.

384
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:48,711
This doesn't seem fair, the
best solution I have heard is

385
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:52,060
from Adam D'Angelo, a very,
very smart guy at Quora.

386
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,520
The idea is to grant options
that are exercisable for

387
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,780
ten years from the grant date,
which should cover,

388
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,700
you know like, all the cases
you know,

389
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,560
whatever happens with the
company.

390
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,110
There are some tricky issues
to this.

391
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,500
Blah, blah, blah.

392
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,060
But it's still far better than
just losing the assets.

393
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,050
I think this is a policy that
all startups should adopt.

394
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,690
So our question is well, like,
was Sam right?

395
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Is this a policy that all
startups should adopt.

396
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,827
So let me first explain again
what the policy is.

397
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:21,130
So currently the way almost
every stock option package in

398
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,443
Silicon Valley works and in
all of startup world is this.

399
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:29,793
That your stock vests, you get
stock invest over a period of

400
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:32,664
time but if you leave the
company,

401
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:37,014
when you leave you have, and
it depends on the company, but

402
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:41,464
I think it's 90 days to
exercise, so yeah, so 90 days.

403
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:45,333
And if you do not buy your
stock in that period,

404
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,300
Like it's not yours anymore.

405
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,470
Which, depending on when you
entered the company,

406
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,490
could be a big problem.

407
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,180
So a lot of companies today
that are valued a lot,

408
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,200
like if you take like a really
valuable startup like say

409
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,900
an Airbnb, or an Uber, or
something like that.

410
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,770
When they bring you in, they
go wow, you know?

411
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,310
Like if you look at your 409A
price.

412
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,330
And to the preferred price.

413
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,720
Like the stock we're giving
your right now,

414
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,242
the options are already worth
like $10 million.

415
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:13,690
And you're like, whoa, $10
million.

416
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,220
I'm rich.

417
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,930
But what they don't
necessarily tell you is,

418
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,840
in order for you to get that
money.

419
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,570
Because their,

420
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,810
the preferred is worth $10
million, your options probably

421
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,390
are going to cost you like
$2.5 million.

422
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,090
When you leave, and

423
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,010
if you don't have that $2.5
million in 90 days, it's gone.

424
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,602
Like you just lost all your
money.

425
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:38,460
And so Sam was like, wow,
that's **** up.

426
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,917
>> And so he wrote a blog
post.

427
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,470
>> And he said everybody
should change it.

428
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,440
And so the first question that
you have to

429
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,950
ask yourself on something like
this is well why is that even,

430
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,180
like this has kind of been
around since like the 80s so

431
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,400
why is a rule like this around
for 30 years.

432
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,780
And it turned out, Sam, and I
don't even,

433
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,680
I, I don't know whether he
like figured this our or

434
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,260
just intuited it, but he was
right.

435
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,960
Like something actually had
changed.

436
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,850
So up until 2004 there used to
be this law called,

437
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,810
APB opinion number 25.

438
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:20,250
That law was the old way to
account for stock options.

439
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,034
And, you know,

440
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,447
it's also the law that all the
guys went to jail on.

441
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:28,247
So I got a lot of people who
cut a case on APB 25.

442
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,200
So I'm glad it's gone.

443
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,100
because it was a very
confusing law.

444
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,860
And a lot of people did not
understand it.

445
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,040
And they literally went to
jail.

446
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,810
But when that was a law,

447
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,180
if you gave somebody ten years
to exercise their

448
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,490
options you would never have
been able to go public.

449
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,820
And you would never have been
able to be acquired.

450
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,330
Because you basically were
taking an expense that was

451
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,530
tied to your stock price.

452
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,100
So basically, the more your
stock went up,

453
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,380
the more compensation expense
you'd have to take.

454
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,710
And the worst thing about it
would be,

455
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,310
is, you wouldn't know what it
was going to be.

456
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,950
So it'd be totally
unpredictable.

457
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,590
So you could never forecast
earnings ever.

458
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,190
Because your earnings would be
a function of

459
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,910
all of your stock price.

460
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,340
And so the more your stock
price went up

461
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,160
the more money you would lose.

462
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,600
And in those days people did
not look through expe,

463
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,850
stock option expenses.

464
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,460
So like it just wasn't doable.

465
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,870
And that's why

466
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,750
everybody's agreement was
written at 90 days.

467
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,400
So that's why it's there.

468
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,830
So absolutely it's the right
thing to

469
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,680
question it being there.

470
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,650
Are you guys following?

471
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,250
You get this?

472
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,274
This is like more complicated
than the first two examples

473
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:40,666
but a very important one.

474
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,157
Okay.

475
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,205
Then so your perspective on
this,

476
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:47,250
if you've got employees, you
want to be fair.

477
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,920
Like nobody wants to like
higher, hey,

478
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,010
you've got all this stock in
four years, psych.

479
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,130
And especially like when you
fire someone.

480
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,930
Hey, you're fired!

481
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,065
I feel real bad about it, but,
you know, guess what?

482
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,673
I'm also going to take all
your money too.

483
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,991
>>
>> You must not feel that bad.

484
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,689
So, like, that's kind of.

485
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:05,610
Like a problem.

486
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,775
But you also, and

487
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,043
this is the thing that you've
got to keep in mind.

488
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:12,173
You also have to think about
the people who are staying,

489
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:14,740
and you want to reward the
people who are staying.

490
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,080
Now the employee,

491
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,460
the perspective of the
employee who leaves.

492
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,340
And this is really critical
because,

493
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,320
this is your reputation,
right?

494
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,900
Like, I worked.

495
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,700
Like, you know, a year's work.

496
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,990
Like, where's my year's pay?

497
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,980
And then, okay, so

498
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,270
now you're telling me about
this 90 day exercise.

499
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,050
And I know it was in,

500
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,480
like, the fine print of my
stock option agreement.

501
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,750
But, my hiring manager never
told me about that.

502
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,720
They never told me I was
going to

503
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,017
need like $2 million to get my
stock, which I don't have.

504
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:45,870
And like so if I was rich,
like, I'd get my stock.

505
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,340
Like, that's not fair.

506
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,080
And so, like, you know, now
I'm fired, and

507
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,720
then I'm screwed.

508
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,220
And guess what?

509
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,120
You know, I'm going to tell
everybody like, how you like,

510
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,970
screwed me over.

511
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,960
And so that's a real
reputational problem.

512
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,053
So that's something that
you've gotta consider in

513
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:01,961
setting this policy.

514
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:04,923
But then you also have to

515
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,177
consider the employee who
stays.

516
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,193
And, one thing that they're
going to ask themselves is,

517
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:12,617
look they're leaving.

518
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:15,673
And every time anybody leaves
it's like, was that smart?

519
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:17,291
Like that's something you,

520
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,038
because these are people who
write,

521
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,870
your employees know each other
better than they know you.

522
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,600
In any company, I don't care
what company you are.

523
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,550
But like often the,

524
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,030
the person they're really
working with is,

525
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,760
is going to be the person they
know more.

526
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,220
And so if that person leaves
they are going to go,

527
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,130
well like, should've I left
too?

528
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,040
Like, what did they get,

529
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,690
and how does that compare to
my deal?

530
00:22:40,767 --> 00:22:44,447
And so, like, if we look at
the situation, and we try and

531
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,540
analyze it, there is a lot of
components to it.

532
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,354
So first is,

533
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:51,611
look, companies tread a lot of
people around here.

534
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:52,342
And I think, like,

535
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,105
really the average is
somewhere around 10%,

536
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:55,314
it's probably getting higher.

537
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,433
Particularly if you're in San
Francisco,

538
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:58,584
it's getting higher.

539
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,953
Just because of the nature of
the culture there.

540
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:04,490
And then, Silicon Valley
companies dilute,

541
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,761
like 6 to 8 or even 10% a year
for employee options.

542
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:12,705
And you have to keep in mind
that, as mean as it may be,

543
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:17,203
if that employee leaves and
can't exercise their options.

544
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:19,688
Then those options come back
to the pool, where you can

545
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:22,970
potentially give them to
people who are already there.

546
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,910
So, you're actually taking
less dilution.

547
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,140
So that's something that you
have to think about.

548
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,320
I'm not saying you have to act
on it,

549
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,522
but it's something that you
have to think about.

550
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:35,110
Then secondly, look,

551
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,160
losing all your stock is a
very big incentive to stay.

552
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,840
And that can be good news or
bad news, right?

553
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,130
Like, it can be good news in
that like,

554
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,710
you get to keep somebody you
might have lost.

555
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,160
It could be bad news in that
you kept them for

556
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,585
the exact wrong reason, right?

557
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,370
because they have handcuffs on
them.

558
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,450
And so you know, you may get
like,

559
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,020
the an employee who's worse
than not having an employee.

560
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,540
But on the other hand,

561
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,100
a ten year option on a highly
volatile security, for

562
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,480
those of you who have taken
that class.

563
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,660
Anybody taking that class?

564
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,110
That's valuable, right?

565
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,310
Ten years options are
volatility and length.

566
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,470
That's the value of an option.

567
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,150
Well, ten years on a start up
stock,

568
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,930
that's a big valuable thing.

569
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,680
And then remember,

570
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,180
the employee who stays doesn't
get that.

571
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,610
The employee who stays just
gets the stock.

572
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,850
They get that, but they don't
get the new job and

573
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,590
the new stock.

574
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,930
So they get one thing but they
don't get both things.

575
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,320
And so, you've gotta weigh
that in.

576
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,240
So this is a hard one.

577
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,220
Like, I think that it should
be

578
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,980
reevaluated by every company.

579
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,960
I wouldn't go as far as to say
it should be adopted by

580
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,740
every company.

581
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,980
I think you have to think
about what you want.

582
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,220
And I would just offer kind of

583
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,510
two alternative cultural
statements.

584
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,540
One is, look we treat
employees with

585
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,200
the utmost
straightforwardness.

586
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,460
We're going to be fair.

587
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,120
And therefore,

588
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,960
like you get ten years to
exercise your stock.

589
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,500
And like what we said we're
going to give you,

590
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,360
you're going to get regardless
of how rich or poor you are.
