1017
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_LgBAGYyo
It's like some times the
people that work for

1018
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,730
you, they have a strong
opinion about where it,

1019
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,400
where it should go.

1020
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,580
And it's a good way to sort
of democratize it

1021
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,939
a little bit, by rotating it
around.

1022
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
Yes.

1023
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,760
>> You said you guys all
work from home.

1024
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,450
Usually seems like a
nightmare.

1025
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,510
In that office, how do you
make that work?

1026
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,510
>> Okay, so we all work from
home.

1027
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,540
So, I will tell you this.

1028
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,610
We all still work within the
Tampa Bay area.

1029
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,760
We would allow anybody to

1030
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,510
work from any where but
usually.

1031
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,904
As we tried to recruit
them,they sort of

1032
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:37,820
meet our team, and they just
decide,

1033
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,500
okay we just want to come
and move here anyway.

1034
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,563
Remote working, is
especially tricky,

1035
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:48,350
a lot of people like to
romanticize it,

1036
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,430
especially people, who are
like employees.

1037
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,110
But the thing is, An office
gives you a lot of, sort of,

1038
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,870
benefits, right, and
efficiencies that you now

1039
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,880
have to compensate for when
you remote working.

1040
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,770
But remote working also has
these other sort of

1041
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,590
efficiencies in place, for
example,

1042
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,870
I don't have to worry about
my employees losing two

1043
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,570
hours of their day to
commuting, for instance.

1044
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,980
So the biggest thing that we
had to do for

1045
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,860
remote working is to respect
people's time.

1046
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,500
And so the way we had it set
up is we actually had

1047
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,470
a four and a half day work
week at Wufoo.

1048
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,840
Half day on Friday was for
all the meetings and stuff.

1049
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,830
We said like no business
deal,

1050
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,990
meetings, no talking with
other outside parties.

1051
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,570
They all have to be done on
Friday, on that half day.

1052
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,320
It couldn't be done in the
middle of the week.

1053
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,420
And then also one day of
everyone was

1054
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,780
already dedicated customer
support.

1055
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,910
So everyone in our company
effectively only had

1056
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,170
three days each week to
actually build or

1057
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,570
work on whatever they were
doing.

1058
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,370
But I actually firmly
believe that if you

1059
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,270
have three solid days,
right, eight to ten hours,

1060
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,230
where you are only working
on what you need to build,

1061
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,350
you can get a ton of shit
done.

1062
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,060
And so what we said was,

1063
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,770
you have to respect
everyone's time during that

1064
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,130
three day period, if they're
in that three day period.

1065
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,270
And what we came up with is
a 15 minute rule and the way

1066
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,580
it worked is you can have a
discussion like a chat or

1067
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,380
a phone call or whatever
with someone but it could go

1068
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,640
no longer than 15 minutes so
if you have some complicated

1069
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,050
issue that you couldn't
figure out we'd say,

1070
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,320
at 15 minutes you are to
immediately table that item.

1071
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,050
Right and have us discuss it
on Friday and

1072
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,610
you'd move on to the next
item on your list right,

1073
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,690
the enhanced productivity.

1074
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,430
More often than not I, I
would say 90% of the time

1075
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,450
the item never got brought
up on Friday because usually

1076
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,810
what would happen is people
would sleep on it and then

1077
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,730
they'd just magically say
like, hey I found a solution

1078
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,740
or like hey that's not a big
problem whatsoever.

1079
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,760
Because most problems inside
of companies,

1080
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,290
they don't need to be solved
in real time, or right away.

1081
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,990
The only things are like
when the site is down, or

1082
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,310
payments aren't working.

1083
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,490
Right?
Everything outside of

1084
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,480
that is basically kind of
luxury, so

1085
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,520
focus on your primaries as
much as possible.

1086
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,419
And, as a result,

1087
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:48,445
our ten person team did far
more than many,

1088
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:51,150
many other companies, as a
result.

1089
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,040
But, it takes extra work to
make remote working happen.

1090
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,070
We are an extremely
disciplined sort of team.

1091
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,370
And I would have to say

1092
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,850
there's almost not many YC
companies that actually have

1093
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,300
been able to replicate sort
of what we do.

1094
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,250
I think there's only two
other companies in YC that

1095
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,060
sort of have the same sort
of discipline working style.

1096
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,560
It takes more work in a very
different fashion.

1097
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,100
Right?

1098
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,780
An office allows you to be a
little bit lazier, right,

1099
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,620
in terms of all these things
around productivity.

1100
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Okay.
Over here.

1101
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,330
>> Right.

1102
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,440
Just to go off that question
as the leader of the team

1103
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,891
how did you manage to
instill a company culture

1104
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:30,948
but and also the count,

1105
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,180
accountability the employees
especially cuz.

1106
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,700
Working space.

1107
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,700
>> Okay, how do we, how do
we set up accountability for

1108
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,390
employees?

1109
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,230
As, as a manager.

1110
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,530
Alright, so, at Wufoo we
were profitable nine months

1111
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,920
after launch, so, we had
profit sharing, right?

1112
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,510
And so, it makes pretty
simple and clear.

1113
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,110
It, it would be a multiple
of whatever bonus pull that

1114
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,420
we sort of had, and

1115
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,720
the performance measures
would be based on sort of,

1116
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,350
how they did in customer
support.

1117
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,880
All right, on their duties
there, and sort of

1118
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,810
what they said they were
wanting to accomplish or do.

1119
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,790
I don't like process, and I
don't like lots of

1120
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,110
tools to help get people to
be productive.

1121
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,547
So the only thing that we
had for

1122
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,040
helping people manage, like,

1123
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,270
sort of their projects, is
to-do lists.

1124
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,810
And that is, like, simple
text files that we

1125
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,490
shared in our Dropbox
account.

1126
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,380
Each person had their name
on it, and you got to

1127
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,710
see every time somebody
updated their to-do list.

1128
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,060
What we said is every single
night just

1129
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,650
set everything that you did
that day.

1130
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,560
Right?
And then on Friday,

1131
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,690
we would just go over.

1132
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,770
Okay, this is what you

1133
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,970
said last week that you're
gonna do.

1134
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,240
This is what you actually
got done, or

1135
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,350
the sort of the problems at
hand.

1136
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,370
And it's super simple,
right?

1137
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,650
It creates this like nice
written trail for

1138
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,550
how to sort of handle stuff,
right?

1139
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,720
And I don't have to worry
about managing them, right?

1140
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,300
They sorta set the tone for

1141
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,610
how they want to be sort of
assessed.

1142
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,550
And it makes it really
simple.

1143
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,370
And for people who are
excellent at what they do.

1144
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,050
Right?
It works very, very well.

1145
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,900
And then when you actually
have problems,

1146
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,570
it's very easy to fire
people.

1147
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,760
I was fortunate that I

1148
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,110
never had to fire anyone at
Wufoo, right?

1149
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,490
But we were able to correct
a lot of

1150
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,530
people's behavior very, very
quickly.

1151
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,750
Cuz we just kinda look at
this, and

1152
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,160
it's like look, this is your
pattern of behavior.

1153
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,510
You finish a fraction of the
items on your list.

1154
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,090
You do most of

1155
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,810
the items at the last second
right before Friday.

1156
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,240
That's a problem, you've
gotta manage your time

1157
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,260
better and this is evidence
that you've provided to us.

1158
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,420
All we have to do is sort of
describe it back to you and

1159
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,065
because everyone in the
company sort of sees it,

1160
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:16,000
right, there's social
pressure that's put

1161
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,870
into place that helps make
it all sort of happen.

1162
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,810
Right here.

1163
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,930
>> How did you hire people
that, you know,

1164
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,630
you felt would be able to
work with in this kind of

1165
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,216
environment that's, that's
>> So,

1166
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:31,720
how do you hire people that
can work, remotely?

1167
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,990
And then sort of work in
this sort of fashion.

1168
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,880
So, pretty easily,

1169
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,170
you have them work on a side
project for you.

1170
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,330
So you contract them out,
and

1171
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,920
they have to work remotely.

1172
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,610
As such, usually, the
projects I like to

1173
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,160
have them work on is about a
month long, right?

1174
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,840
I could do things much
faster for a week.

1175
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,010
But usually get a good sense
of,

1176
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,870
like, how well people sort
of manage themselves, and

1177
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,930
work on things from a
project like that.

1178
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,750
So that was always the first
assessment.

1179
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,560
Like we never did anything
just by interviews.

1180
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,740
The other thing we had to,
sort of, screen them for

1181
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,350
is their ability to do
customer support.

1182
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,190
Because not any,

1183
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,980
every engineer sort of has
the empathy skills to

1184
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,130
handle that stress.

1185
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,100
So sometimes I would have
people write breakup letters

1186
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,440
to me, right, in an
interview, just like hey,

1187
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,310
pretend you have to break up
with me you have 15 minutes

1188
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,320
to write in on there and you
can only write it by hand,

1189
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,600
what are you gonna say?

1190
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,740
And so you get a good sense
of sort of their writing

1191
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,670
skills, because like 90% of
what you do in customer

1192
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,940
support is tell them bad
news, like, oh, we don't

1193
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,710
support that feature, sorry
that's not gonna work, or.

1194
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,070
It's not gonna be available.

1195
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,985
And so people have to have
sort of tacked at that.

1196
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:36,300
>> How 'bout one more
question?

1197
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,650
>> One question, right here
the glasses.

1198
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,430
>> So, since Wiki has all
these like tricks and

1199
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,530
experiments that have really
helped the company.

1200
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,950
Do you INAUDIBLE] of ones
that didn't work out?

1201
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,120
>> Have all these tricks and

1202
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,240
experiments to help the
company,

1203
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,360
are there any ones that
didn't work out?

1204
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,520
All right, I'll talk about
one.

1205
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,770
So one of the things that we
did early on to try to

1206
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,940
motivate ourselves was try
to get,

1207
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,300
like we understood this idea
of like crunch mode and

1208
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,820
that it's really bad for
people.

1209
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,370
Like if you're doing the
subscription business you

1210
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,230
need people to last for the
long term, and

1211
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,400
video games a lot of times
they like crunch people.

1212
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,660
All, all the time.

1213
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,860
For like a specific deadline
or

1214
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,610
have multiple sprints every
two weeks and

1215
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,930
you have to shoot up to this
deadline and

1216
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,290
it's like exhausting.

1217
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,090
And so, because, when it's
happening it's like you

1218
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,560
might get an increase in
productivity but

1219
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,300
the recovery period that you
need for people is

1220
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,770
always greater, right, than
the productivity you gain.

1221
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,630
And at a company where you

1222
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,810
need everyone doing customer
support and

1223
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,420
being on their game and
constantly put, pushed out

1224
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,910
features you don't have time
for recovery.

1225
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,490
So, we were thinking about,
okay, we want to build like,

1226
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,740
a company vacation into how
Wufoo sort of works to

1227
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,300
reward our users every
single year.

1228
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,830
And we said okay,

1229
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,330
if the vacation is sort of
built in there for

1230
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,030
the recovery, we could have
one crunch period, right,

1231
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,300
before that vacation set up.

1232
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,470
And we'll just only do
customer support that will

1233
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,430
just sort of scale with
people.

1234
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,260
So.

1235
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,070
The way we did the very
first crunch mode

1236
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,380
is that it was just between
the three founders.

1237
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,900
And we had each of us draw a
ten-item to-do list.

1238
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,140
That would be fairly
aggressive.

1239
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,890
And the first person to

1240
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,640
get through seven of their
items would win.

1241
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,030
And the the last person to

1242
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,630
get through seven of their
items.

1243
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,950
Would become what we called
trippage.

1244
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,180
And trippage meant that you
carried other

1245
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,630
person's luggage and got
people drinks when you're on

1246
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,500
the company vacation.

1247
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,540
So we did that and during
that period,

1248
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,140
everyone was like pretty
excited about it and

1249
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,850
motivated, and only the
winner got to

1250
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,640
choose the next company
vacation the following year.

1251
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,240
And then all the sudden Ryan
had basically poorly

1252
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,050
estimated the items on his
list.

1253
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,400
And he realized very quickly
I'm going to fucking lose.

1254
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,950
And so he was just like I
give up.

1255
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,250
And he just sort of stopped.

1256
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,410
So crunch mode turned out to
be blah mode for

1257
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,340
him because he knew he was
gonna lose and

1258
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,030
became pretty demoralized.

1259
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,380
So as a result of doing
that, we

1260
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,130
decided not to do it in that
similar fashion anymore.

1261
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,610
So, good idea that we like
to talk about.

1262
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,980
But is one that we, we never
did again.

1263
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,750
All right, guys.

1264
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,930
Thanks a lot.
