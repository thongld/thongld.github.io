00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,410

You should ask Brian what he
thinks,

520
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,613
cuz they've done these
amazing storyboards which I

521
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,765
think has been shared, of
like the journey through

522
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,338
a user's moment on life on,
on Airbnb and how excited.

523
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,300
Isn't, he's talking in three
lectures time?

524
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,980
The guy's awesome at talking
about the magic moment and

525
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,410
getting his users to feel
love and

526
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,980
joy and all this stuff.

527
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,600
So think about what the
magic moment is for

528
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,870
your product, and

529
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,830
get people connected to it
as fast as possible.

530
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,440
Because then you

531
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,000
can move up where that blue
line has asymptoted.

532
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,832
Then you can go from 50%
retention to 60% retention

533
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,782
to 70% retention easily, if
you can connect people with

534
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,030
the thing that makes them
stick on your site.

535
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,600
The second thing to think
about is everyone in

536
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,380
the Valley gets wrong, that
we optimize when we

537
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,050
think about growth for
ourselves.

538
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,060
So my favorite example is
notifications.

539
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Again, talk to lots of
companies, advise lots of

540
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,900
companies, every single
company when they

541
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,190
talk about notifications,
goes, oh I'm getting too

542
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,890
many notifications, I think
that's what we

543
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,830
need to optimize for in
notifications.

544
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,998
Okay, are your power users
leaving your site

545
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:51,093
because they're getting too
many notifications?

546
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,122
No, then why would you
optimize that,

547
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:55,960
they're probably grownups
and they can use filters.

548
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,850
What you need to focus on is
the marginal user.

549
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,760
The one person who doesn't
get a notification in

550
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,360
a given day, or month, or
year.

551
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,070
Our experience of our
products, and

552
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,740
by the way like building an
awesome product is

553
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,120
all about thinking about the
power user, right?

554
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
Building an incredible
product

555
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,800
is definitely optimizing for

556
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,870
the people who use your
product the most.

557
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,350
But driving growth,

558
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,210
people who are already using
your product all the time,

559
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,500
are not the ones you have to
worry about.

560
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,783
So, in this Danny Ferrante
video there's also this link

561
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:28,733
from the lecture page,

562
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,063
there's also talk about our
growth accounting framework

563
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,601
that we use to think about
for growth.

564
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,067
And we looked at new users,
resurrected users,

565
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,534
people who weren't on
Facebook for 30 days and

566
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:39,174
came back, and churned
users.

567
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:41,169
And the resurrected and
churn numbers for

568
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,278
pretty much every product
I've ever seen,

569
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:44,970
dominate the new user
account.

570
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,100
Once you reach a sensible
point of growth,

571
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,030
a couple of years, and
whatever.

572
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,840
And all those users who were
churning and

573
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,030
resurrecting, had low friend
counts.

574
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,410
And didn't find their
friends, and

575
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,470
so weren't connected to

576
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,040
the great stuff that was
going on, on Facebook.

577
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,838
And so the number one thing
we needed to focus on

578
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,960
was getting them to those
ten friends, getting them to

579
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,733
the whatever number of
friends they needed.

580
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,448
So think about the user on
the margin,

581
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,217
don't think about where
yourself when

582
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,730
you're thinking about
growth.

583
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,590
So, operating for

584
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,020
growth, what you really need
to think about is,

585
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,708
what is the north star of
your company.

586
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,520
What is the one metric
where,

587
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,810
if everyone in the company
is thinking about it and

588
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,530
driving their product was
that metric and

589
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,410
their actions towards moving
that metric up, you know in

590
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,660
the long run your company
will be successful.

591
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,292
And by the way,

592
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,333
they're probably all
correlated to each other so

593
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,894
it's fine to pick almost any
metric.

594
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:35,643
Whichever one is like the
deepest, like, that you feel

595
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,334
the best about, that aligns
with like your mission and

596
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,750
your values, probably go for
that one.

597
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,680
But realistically, daily
active users

598
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,360
fairly correlated to monthly
active users.

599
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,700
We could've gone with either
one.

600
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,020
Amount of content shared,
also very correlated to

601
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,230
how many users there are
because, guess what,

602
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,720
you add a user, they share
content.

603
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,640
So, lots of things end up
being correlated.

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,710
Pick the one that fits with
you and

605
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,550
that you know you're gonna
be able to stick with for

606
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,510
a long time, but have a
north star.

607
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,140
Have a north star and know
the magic moment that when

608
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,490
a user experiences that,
they will deliver on that

609
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,890
metric for you on the north
star, and then think about

610
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,810
the marginal user, don't
think about yourself.

611
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,400
Those are, I think, the
really important points when

612
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,370
you're operating for growth.

613
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,900
Everything has to come from
the top.

614
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,812
So the last area here is
tactics.

615
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,548
And my hope was that I could
hit a few of these and then

616
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,935
I've got a list of tactics I
wanna go through that

617
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,673
I'm better talking with a
whiteboard and whatever on,

618
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,178
but you can ask me questions
as I'm going through on

619
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,530
those about how they work
and what goes better.

620
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,890
But the important tactics
that you need to think about

621
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,090
this is great guy by the
way,

622
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,980
Tom Fishburne, he lives, he
lives in the Bay Area and

623
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,620
he does these really cynical
cartoons that I love.

624
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,930
So let's say you found your,

625
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,310
your niche market that
you're gonna have

626
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,580
a monopoly on inside the
mousetrap market.

627
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,580
It's a silenced mousetrap
that's sitting under beds so

628
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,550
that if the mice come to
your bed overnight,

629
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,690
like they can be killed
without waking you up, so

630
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,040
that's your niche market.

631
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,760
And your, your mousetrap is
better than anybody else for

632
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,650
that market.

633
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,260
What typically happens in
Silicon Valley is,

634
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,430
everyone think mar, thinks
marketers are useless.

635
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,880
Like I thought marketers
were useless when I

636
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,770
was a physics student, so
I'm

637
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,950
sure as engineering students
you must thing we're awful,

638
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,570
awful people who aren't
useful to have around.

639
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,350
Like, build it and they will
come.

640
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,350
That is something that is
very much the mantra in

641
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,890
the Valley and I don't
believe it's true.

642
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,190
I believe you actually have
to work.

643
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,700
There's a good article,
again, in the lecture page,

644
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,920
from interviewing Ben
Silvermann where he

645
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,990
talks about how the growth
of

646
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,300
Pinterest was driven by
marketing.

647
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,820
It's a really good article
to read into.

648
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm biased, of course.

649
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,890
So, the first tactic I

650
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,680
want to talk about is
internationalization.

651
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,720
Facebook internationalized
too late.

652
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,510
Sheryl said it broadly in
public and

653
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,250
I definitely agree with
that.

654
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,480
One of the biggest barriers
to our long term growth and

655
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
one of the biggest things we
have to deal with was

656
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,629
all the countries where
there were clones.

657
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:59,094
Famously Studeveldt said had
Fakebook.css in their,

658
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,050
in their HTML.

659
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,560
And there were a ton of
sites like that out there,

660
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,563
whether it was Studeveldt
site as a clear clone,

661
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:09,790
Vkontakte, Mixi, Cyworld,
Orkut, there were all these

662
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,610
different social networks
around the world that

663
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,840
grew up while Facebook was
focused on the US.

664
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,550
And so internationalizing
was an important barrier we

665
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,840
needed to knock down, and
knocking down barriers is

666
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,150
often a very important to
think about for growth.

667
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,090
Facebook started off as
college only.

668
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,010
So every college that it

669
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,579
was launched in was knocking
down a barrier.

670
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,460
When Facebook expanded
beyond colleges to

671
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,480
high schools I wasn't at the
company, but that was a

672
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,110
company shaking moment where
people questioned whether or

673
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,740
not Facebook could actually
survive,

674
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,590
the culture of the site
could survive.

675
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,910
Then expanding from high
schools to everyone,

676
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,760
that was like, just before I
joined and

677
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,950
that was a shocking moment
and

678
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,800
that spurred the growth on
to 50 million and

679
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,690
then we hit a brick wall.

680
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,406
And when we hit that brick
wall that was

681
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,422
the point when a lot of
existential questions were

682
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:54,582
being asked inside Facebook
about whether any social

683
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,240
network could ever get to
more than 100 million users.

684
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,020
Which sounds stupid now, but

685
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,870
at the time no one had ever
achieved it.

686
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,320
Everyone had kind of tapped
out between 50 and

687
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,520
100 million users and

688
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,010
we were worried that it
wasn't possible.

689
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,680
And that was the point at

690
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,860
which the growth team got
set up.

691
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,390
Chimoff brought a whole
bunch of us together.

692
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,771
It was he said very publicly
that he wanted to fire me on

693
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:17,085
multiple occasions, and he
probably should have done.

694
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,065
But, without Chimoff I

695
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:20,130
think none of us would have
stayed at the company.

696
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,080
We were a really weird bunch
of people, but

697
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,400
it worked out.

698
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,060
And, the two things we did,
I think, that really,

699
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,980
really drove growth
initially, was number one,

700
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,060
we focused on that ten
friends in 14 days and

701
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,250
getting users to the magic
moment.

702
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,170
And that was something Zuck
drove,

703
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,100
cuz we were all stuck in
analysis paralysis,

704
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,060
saying is it causation, is
it correlation.

705
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,390
Zuck was like, you really
think if no one

706
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,460
gets a friend that they'll
be active on Facebook?

707
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,110
Are you crazy?

708
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,850
The second thing was
internationalization.

709
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,240
It was knocking down another
barrier.

710
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,450
And when we launched it, I
think there were

711
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,380
two things that we did
really well.

712
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,450
Number one was, even though
we were late, and

713
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,330
we were stressed about being
late,

714
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,660
we took the time to build it
in a scalable way.

715
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,900
We moved slow to move fast.

716
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,790
And you can actually read,

717
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,870
hear the full story from
Naomi in one of

718
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,060
the videos linked from the
lecture page.

719
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,950
But what we did was we
wrapped all the strings in

720
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,840
the site in FPT which our
translation script, and

721
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,730
then, or translation
extraction script, and then,

722
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,220
we created the community
translation platform.

723
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,390
So that we didn't just have

724
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,420
professional translators
translating a site we

725
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,330
could have all of our users
translating a site.

726
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,350
And we got French translated
in 12 hours, but

727
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,280
we managed to get to this
day we are now at

728
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,182
104 languages translated by
Facebook for Facebook.

729
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:40,470
80 plus 70 of those are
translated by the community.

730
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,330
And we took the time to

731
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,980
build something that would
enable us to scale.

732
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,920
The other thing is we

733
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,810
prioritized the right
languages.

734
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,390
So back then the right
languages,

735
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,200
the big four languages were
French, Italian, German and

736
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,530
Spanish, figs and Chinese,
but

737
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,260
we were blocked in China.

738
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:01,428
>> So we focused on French,
Italian, German,

739
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,870
and Spanish.

740
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,670
Now look at that list,

741
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,520
that's today's distribution
of languages.

742
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,090
Italian isn't on the list
anymore.

743
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,050
French and German are about
to fall off.

744
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,100
In the last year we
quadrupled the number of

745
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,700
people on Facebook in Hindi,
quadrupled.

746
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,840
And so building for

747
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,910
where the world is today, is
an easy mistake to make and

748
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,450
it's what a lot of the other
social networks did.

749
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,630
We built a scalable
translation infrastructure

750
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,880
that actually enabled us to
attack all of the languages,

751
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,760
so we can be ready for

752
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,420
where the future is going
to, is gonna be.

753
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,560
And you'll probably be able
to see some stuff

754
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,370
from our Internet.org Summit
in India about where we

755
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,595
want to go with language
translations later today,

756
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:41,320
cuz I think they're talking
about that stuff there.

757
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,860
So these are the tactics I
wanna go through now, and

758
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,970
I'll stick with the white
board for that stuff.

759
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,040
But I'd really encourage you
guys as I go through these,

760
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,140
if you've got any questions
about them let me know.

761
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,570
I think this should be like,

762
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,380
a more free form time
anyway.

763
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,110
But I think some these

764
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,060
tactics are quite
interesting.

765
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,340
So Virality.

766
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:03,551
Yes, I think there are two
ways to look at virality.

767
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,606
There's a great book whoops,
the book on the right here,

768
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,749
by Adam Penenberg, Viral
Loop,

769
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:13,193
goes through a bunch of case
studies of companies that

770
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,160
have grown through viral
marketing.

771
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,140
And I strongly encourage
you, if

772
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,160
you're interested in viral
marketing, to get that book.

773
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,012
I think Ogilvy on
Advertising's great as well

774
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,196
because chapter seven he's
like if you can't think of

775
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:25,142
anything else stick a car to
a billboard with

776
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:27,560
super glue and people will
buy your super glue.

777
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,372
And he's got some really,
