509
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,200
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_LgBAGYyo
only one person dedicated
support a day, or any shift.

510
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,180
Results in about 400 issues
a week.

511
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,110
That's about 800 emails.

512
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,928
But a response time from 9
a.m.

513
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:06,440
to 9 p.m.
was

514
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,865
between seven to 12 minutes.

515
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:08,980
Right?
And from 9 p.m.

516
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,130
to midnight it was an hour.

517
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,030
And on the weekend it would
be no longer than 24 hours.

518
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,020
And we carried this up all
the way up to the scale.

519
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,780
What a lot of people forget
about, and

520
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,020
often talk about with
Airbnb, is how, like oh,

521
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,870
they did this interesting
thing where they had,

522
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,700
went up to New York and
offered, like,

523
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,280
professional photographers,
and the founders would go

524
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
out there and actually take
pictures of

525
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,860
the people's apartments to
help them sell more.

526
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,390
Focusing on the stories
around conversion.

527
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,440
What most people don't
realize is a lot of

528
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,783
times when I saw Joe in the
early days of Airbnb,

529
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,301
he had a phone, sort of head
set stuck to his head all

530
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,072
the time, because he was
doing phone support nonstop.

531
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,307
Churn is a story we don't
like to talk about often,

532
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,280
all the time.

533
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,540
Airbnb's sort of growth
really started picking up

534
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,440
once they figured out

535
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,030
how to match capacity to the
demand, or the phone

536
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,730
calls that they were getting
into their support system.

537
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,960
At Wufoo we actually
constantly did experiments

538
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,550
around support, because
we're so obsessed with it.

539
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,540
One experiment we did was,
we heard Kathy Sierra

540
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,860
do a talk about there's a
disconnect between the

541
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,580
motions that we have when we
need help, and sort of.

542
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,620
The content and the
reactions we get from

543
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,430
people when we get help from
them, especially online.

544
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,780
Because they just don't see
all those nonverbal cues.

545
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,440
So she said unless there's
face recognition on the web,

546
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,420
we're just always going to
be

547
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,980
disconnected from our users.

548
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,760
Our feeling was,

549
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,110
like, well we're not face
recognition experts but

550
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,700
I think there's another way
of getting empathy.

551
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,710
So, as form builders, we
added a drop-down and

552
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,590
what we said was like, hey,
what's your emotional state?

553
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,180
And our hypothesis was

554
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,300
that no one was gonna fill
this out.

555
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,790
We basically thought, oh
okay, you know what the,

556
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,910
this is gonna be pretty a
lame experiment, but

557
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,930
we'll see how it sort of
goes.

558
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,125
And it turned out the
Emotional State

559
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,770
drop-down field was filled
out 75.8% of the time.

560
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,374
The browser type drop-down
filled just in

561
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,184
comparison was filled out
78.1% of the time.

562
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:00,816
All right?

563
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:03,337
So people were basically
telling us, for

564
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:06,506
my technical support issue
how I feel about this

565
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:10,036
problem is just as important
as, like, all the technical

566
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:13,220
details you need to sorta
figure out how to debug it.

567
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,580
Now we didn't prioritize
things or

568
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,380
triage things by emotion,
right, and for

569
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,860
the most part, people didn't
game the system.

570
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,820
One of the interesting
byproducts of it was that we

571
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,450
noticed that people started
being nicer to

572
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,850
us in the customer support.

573
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,270
It was something sort of
subconscious.

574
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,590
We just were thinking like,
wow,

575
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,870
users are so much better
now.

576
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,430
What's going on?

577
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,710
And we went back and looked
at the data and

578
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,910
we did some text analysis
and we realized is that, oh,

579
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,790
when it comes to only
communicating with

580
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,620
people over written words,
like email, there's

581
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,750
only three ways that you
show strong emotions, right?

582
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,560
Exclamation marks curse
words, and all caps.

583
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,140
And sure enough on all three
of those metrics,

584
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,840
they've gone down.

585
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,070
In sort of the way people
were talking to us in

586
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,340
the customer support.

587
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Once people had a simple
outlet for their emotions,

588
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,340
right, people would be a lot
more rational,

589
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,997
and it made our jobs a lot
more pleasant as a result.

590
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:08,860
The other byproduct that is
awesome is that

591
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,280
you actually build better
software when you do this.

592
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,310
Far better software.

593
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,090
This is actually backed up
by tons of research.

594
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,190
Jared Spool, a user
interface engineer, which is

595
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,745
sort of the big players in
this space says like,

596
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,400
there's a direct correlation
to how much time we

597
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,810
spend directly exposed to
users and

598
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,080
how good our designs sort of
get.

599
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
He says it has to come in
this specific way.

600
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
It has to be direct
exposure, right?

601
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,710
It can't be something where

602
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,370
someone generates a report
or through a graph, you

603
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,070
have to be interacting with
them somewhat real time.

604
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,290
It has to be a minimum of
every six weeks.

605
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,180
And it has to be for at
least two hours.

606
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,720
Otherwise your software will
get worse over time.

607
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,086
Our developers, our people
who are on,

608
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:51,200
on Wufoo were getting
exposed to our users four to

609
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,820
eight hours every single
week.

610
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,570
And what it does is it
changes the way you sort of

611
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,437
build software.

612
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,150
Jared Spool has another way
of talking about how

613
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,380
we build products.

614
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,650
Right?

615
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,780
Let's imagine that this
represents all the knowledge

616
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,900
needed to sort of use your
app on a spectrum.

617
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,770
Right?
This is like no knowledge.

618
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,340
Right?
And this is

619
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,780
all the knowledge needed.

620
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,300
Right?
And

621
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,280
these two lines are pretty
much your interactions with

622
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,610
users what you're trying to
get them to.

623
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,270
This is currently where
their knowledge point is and

624
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,460
this is the target knowledge
point that you're trying to

625
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,250
get them to, to understand
that to use your app.

626
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,102
The gap between those is
called the knowledge gap,

627
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,497
Jared Spool called it, Spool
calls.

628
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:31,846
And what's interesting about
this is there's only two

629
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,280
ways, right, to sort of fix
this.

630
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,130
That gap represents how
intuitive your

631
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,010
app is, right?

632
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,210
You either get the user to
increase their

633
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,080
knowledge or you decrease
the amount of knowledge

634
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,872
that's needed to use your
application.

635
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:48,450
And oftentimes, as engineers
and people who build and

636
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,699
work on products, we think
let's add new features.

637
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,790
And new features only

638
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,150
means let's increase the
knowledge gap.

639
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,070
So for us we actually
focused a lot on

640
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,792
the other sort of direction.

641
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,530
And so what that meant we
spent a lot of time,

642
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,870
30% of our engineering time
was spent on internal tools

643
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,102
to help with our customer
support stuff.

644
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:10,020
But oftentimes it

645
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,750
was spent helping people
help themselves.

646
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,870
Things like frequently asked
questions, tool tips.

647
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,650
Things like, if you just
click the help link,

648
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,510
right, instead of taking you
to the generic help sort of

649
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,480
documentation page,

650
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,150
you go to the specific page
where you're looking at

651
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,540
is going to be most, sort
of,

652
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,960
appropriate for what you're
working on.

653
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
We redesigned our
documentation over and

654
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,870
over again, AB tested it
constantly.

655
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,040
One iteration of our
documentation reduced

656
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,029
customer support by 30% over
night.

657
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,090
It's one of those things
where,

658
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,400
like, overnight, all the
people that work on

659
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,960
the product immediately had
30% less work to do.

660
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,490
Now what happens if you have
everyone work on

661
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,630
customer support constantly,
and

662
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,220
thinking about it in terms
of a remarkable way?

663
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,430
Well, I talked a lot about,

664
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,290
in the very beginning growth
is a function of

665
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,000
conversion and churn.

666
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,140
This is Wufoo's growth curve
for the first five years.

667
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,270
Right?

668
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,390
What's interesting is that
we

669
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,020
paid no money on
advertising, on marketing.

670
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,720
All of it was done by word
of mouth growth.

671
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,800
Right?

672
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,480
And the interaction between,
like,

673
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,460
new users and downgrades are
this.

674
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,940
It's so slight what it
takes, that gap,

675
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,800
making that sort of work.

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,710
And what a lot of people
keep forgetting is that

677
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,970
there's almost no difference
between an increase in

678
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,370
conversion rate, 1% increase
and a 1% decrease churn.

679
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,840
They do exactly the same
thing to your growth.

680
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,710
However, the ladder is
actually much easier to do.

681
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,380
It's much cheaper to do, in
your apps, and

682
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,940
a lot of the times we
neglect this,

683
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,010
neglect this to way far
along.

684
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,960
Right?
And we usually have our

685
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,090
B team works on these sort
of projects and services.

686
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,770
This is actually not the
graph that we track most of

687
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,250
the time at Wufoo, it's not
even the one I'm proud of.

688
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,855
This is the one I'm proud
of.

689
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:54,980
Cuz even though we have this
sort of nice, awesome curve

690
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,040
of growth, this is what, how
loud is this scale?

691
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,340
Keep the company small, have
an awesome culture.

692
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
And that required doing a
lot of

693
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,796
these things to help people
sort of do what they need.

694
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:13,709
So John Gotman noticed there
was a different type of

695
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:18,978
behavior for relationships
and why people divorced.

696
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,938
Basically there would be
some subset of people who

697
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:24,404
would stay together 10, 15
years and

698
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,870
then all of a sudden they
divorce and

699
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,899
there was none of the other
indicators which sort of

700
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,320
show that this is what was
gonna happen.

701
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,067
And I was looking through
the data and

702
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,868
I realized oh, there's no
passion,

703
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,194
there's no fire between
these people, right?

704
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,679
When it comes to
relationships they

705
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,059
kinda follow the second law
of thermodynamics, right?

706
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,506
In a closed energy system
things tend to run down so

707
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,662
you have to constantly be
putting energy and

708
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:47,720
effort back into it.

709
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,430
Now the way a lot of people
sort of think about showing

710
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,040
people that I care about you
in products and in companies

711
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,870
is to do things like let's
have a blog, right?

712
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,240
Lets' have a newsletter?

713
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,870
The thing is, we look at
these rates and basically it

714
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,960
was such a small percentage
of our active users that it

715
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,290
was like, most of our users
have no idea all

716
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,660
the awesome stuff that we're
doing for them.

717
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,980
So we built a new tool.

718
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,540
We called it the Wufoo
system, and

719
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,570
what it allowed us to do was
just time stamp every new

720
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,990
feature that we're building
for users and

721
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,540
then every time they would
log in, we would look at

722
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,830
the difference between their
log in time or last log in

723
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,580
time and the new features
that were implemented.

724
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,120
And when you had this
message show up,

725
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,030
hey since you've been gone

726
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,800
here's all the awesome stuff
that Wufoo did for you.

727
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,840
Hands down this was the most
talked about feature I've

728
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,585
ever had every time I went
out to talk to users.

729
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,860
Right they'd say like dude I
love that since you've be,

730
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,490
since you've gone thing even
though I pay the same amount

731
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,510
every single month you guys
are doing something for

732
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,110
me almost every week and
it's totally awesome and

733
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,780
makes me feel, I'm getting
maximum value.

734
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
The other thing that we did
in

735
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,030
addition to having everyone
support the people that

736
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,500
paid their pay check is have
them say thank you.

737
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,790
And this was a large part
due to us injecting sort of

738
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,280
humility and modesty in to
sort of the equation.

739
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,270
Every single Friday we would
get together and

740
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,350
we'd just write simple hand
written thank you cards to

741
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,029
our users.

742
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,606
And I know there's tons of
people who would not be sort

743
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,799
of excited about doing this,
but it was a ritual that

744
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,485
made sort of all the
difference in terms of,

745
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:19,822
like, having a team that was
very tightly neat,

746
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:21,226
tightly knit, also.

747
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,190
And working on stuff that
they really cared about.

748
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,130
They always constantly knew
what the mission was for,

749
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,960
and why we sort of did what
we did.

750
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,010
These aren't fancy thank you
cards, right?

751
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,810
They're just simple,

752
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,860
like handwritten stuff on an
index card.

753
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,990
We threw in a sticker, and

754
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,140
slapped on a dinosaur on the
front of it.

755
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,720
And, what's interesting is
we started this practice as

756
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,830
a result of the early days
of starting Wufoo.

757
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,039
Chris, Ron, and I were
talking, and we're trying to

758
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,103
figure out, what are we
gonna do to sort of show

759
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,139
users that we appreciate
them around Christmas.

760
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,341
And he, Chris came up with
this idea where he said

761
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:58,825
hey guys, so a couple years
ago my mom, like, made me

762
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:01,831
write thank you notes to all
of my relatives.
