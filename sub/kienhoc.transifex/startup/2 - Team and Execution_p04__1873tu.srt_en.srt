757
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,790
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfnkM44Urs
is to have vesting on the
equity.

758
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,010
Uh, we pretty much won't
fund a company now,

759
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,420
where the founders don't
have vested equity

760
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,580
vesting equity, cuz it's
just that bad.

761
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,250
The other thing to do is as
soon as problems come up

762
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,360
in the relationship between
the cofounders,

763
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,940
which happens to some degree
in every company.

764
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,700
Um, talk about it early,

765
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,155
don't let it just sit off
there and fester.

766
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:43,215
If you have to choose
between hiring an employee

767
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:46,886
that's not ideal and losing
your customer, you lose one

768
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:49,940
of the particular working
>> If you have to choose

769
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,560
between hiring a suboptimal
employee and losing

770
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,250
your customers to your
competitor what do you do?

771
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,732
Um, if it would be one of
the first five,

772
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:01,060
say employees of the
company.

773
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,080
Uh, I would lose those
customers.

774
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,150
Um, I just,

775
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,830
I think the damage that it
does to the company.

776
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,060
Um, you, you know, you don't
wanna, it's better to lose

777
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,980
some customers than kill the
company.

778
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,310
Um, later on I might have a
slightly different opinion,

779
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,860
but it's really hard to say
in the general case.

780
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,302
How about one more question,
and I'll keep going, yes?

781
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:22,304
>> Uh, what's your
experience with cofounders

782
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:24,368
who aren't working uh, in
the same location?

783
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,124
>> I'm gonna get to that
later.

784
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,018
The question is what about
cofounders that are not

785
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,170
working in the same
location.

786
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,500
>> Um, don't do it.

787
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,610
I am skeptical of remote
teams in general.

788
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,770
But in the early days of a
startup where

789
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,010
communication and speed
outweigh everything else.

790
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,750
Um, for whatever reason,
video conferencing or

791
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,410
calls just don't work that
well.

792
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,710
The data on this is look at
the say, like,

793
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,960
30 most successful software
startups of all time.

794
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
And try to point to a single
example

795
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,330
where the cofounders were in
different locations.

796
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,260
It's really, really tough.

797
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,370
Um, all right.

798
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,948
We'll skip a little bit of
this.

799
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:04,848
All right.

800
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:09,830
So, now we're gonna talk
about execution.

801
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,650
Um, execution for most
founders is

802
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,850
not the more fun part of
starting a company.

803
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,850
But it is often the most
critical.

804
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,900
Um, most people that start a
company think that they

805
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,630
are signing up to have this
brilliant idea.

806
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,340
And, you know, then they're
just going to be,

807
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,870
like, be on magazine covers
and go to parties.

808
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:30,483
>> But really what it's
about more than

809
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:33,563
anything else, what, what
being a founder means is, is

810
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,642
signing up for this year's
long grind on execution, and

811
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,200
you can't outsource this.

812
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,160
Um, the way to have a
company that executes well

813
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,830
is to execute well yourself.

814
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,310
Everything in startup gets
modeled after the founders.

815
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,409
Whatever the founders do
becomes the culture.

816
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:51,705
So if you want a culture
where people work hard and

817
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:54,169
pay attention to detail and
focus on the customer and

818
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:54,897
are frugal um,

819
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:57,148
you have to do it yourself
there is no other way.

820
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,644
You cannot hire a COO and
have them, you know,

821
00:29:59,644 --> 00:30:01,827
do this while you go off to
conferences.

822
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,597
The company just needs to
see you as

823
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,680
like this maniacal execution
machine.

824
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,140
As I said in the first
lecture,

825
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,890
there's like a hundred times
at least more people with

826
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,580
great ideas.

827
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,920
Than people that are willing
to put in the effort,

828
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,110
um, to execute them well.

829
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,290
Ideas by themselves are not
worth anything.

830
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,520
Only executing well is what,
what adds value,

831
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,480
or what creates value.

832
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,860
A big part of execution is
just putting in the effort.

833
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,880
Um, but there is a lot you
can learn about how to

834
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,370
be good at it and so we're
gonna have I

835
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,730
think three classes that
just talk about this.

836
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,284
Uh, so the CEO, people have
asked me a bunch of

837
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,795
times like the jobs of the
start up CEO.

838
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,393
And there are probably more
than five but, you know,

839
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:44,540
here are five that come up a
lot in the early days.

840
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,420
Um, the first four,

841
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,830
I think everyone thinks of
as CEO jobs.

842
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,506
Set the vision.

843
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:50,489
Raise money.

844
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,919
Evangelize the company to
people you're trying to

845
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:53,432
recruit.

846
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:55,308
Existing employees,
partners, press,

847
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:56,970
customers, everybody.

848
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,380
Hire and manage the team.

849
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,030
Um, but the fifth one is
setting the execution bar,

850
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,940
and this is not something
that

851
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,470
most founders get excited
about.

852
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,630
Probably think about
themselves doing that I

853
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,900
think is actually one of the
critical CEO roles.

854
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,270
And no one but the CEO can
do this.

855
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,570
Um execution gets divided
into two, two key questions.

856
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,580
One can you figure out what
to do?

857
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,860
And two can you get it done?

858
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,970
Um so I wanna talk about two
parts of getting it done.

859
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,010
Assuming that you've already
figured out what to do.

860
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,120
Um, and those are focus and
intensity.

861
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,120
Ah, so, so focus is
critical.

862
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,240
Um, one of my favorite
questions to ask founders

863
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,580
is what they're spending
their time and money on.

864
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,700
Um, this reveals almost
everything,

865
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,040
about what founders think is
important.

866
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,560
One of the hardest parts
about being a founder.

867
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,670
Is it there are 100
important

868
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,160
things competing for your
attention every day.

869
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,560
Um, and you have to identify
the right two or three, work

870
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,000
on those and then ignore or
delegate or defer the rest.

871
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,180
And a lot of these things
that,

872
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,450
that founders think are
really important, you know.

873
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,880
Interviewing a lot of
different law firms,

874
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,290
going to conferences,
recruiting advisors,

875
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,970
whatever, they just don't
matter, right?

876
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,360
And what really does matter,
varies with time but

877
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,841
it's an important piece of
May Day advice.

878
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,170
You need to figure out what
the two or

879
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,500
three most important things
are and then just do those.

880
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,352
And you can only have two or
three things every day,

881
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,088
because everything else will
just come at you.

882
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:22,389
You know fires of the day,
and

883
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:24,837
if you don't get really good
at setting what these two or

884
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:26,790
three priorities are every
day.

885
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,720
Um, you'll never be great at
actually getting stuff done.

886
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,660
This is really hard for
founders right.

887
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,780
Founders are people that get

888
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,110
excited by starting new
things.

889
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,400
Unfortunately, the trick to
great execution is to

890
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,530
say no a lot.

891
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,110
You know, you're saying no
97 times out of 100,

892
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,370
um, and most founders find
that they have to

893
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,090
make a very conscious effort
to do this.

894
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,940
Most startups are not nearly
focused enough.

895
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,840
They work really hard,
maybe, but

896
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,560
they don't work hard on the
right things.

897
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,020
And you'll still fail.

898
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,120
Um, one of the great and

899
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,570
terrible things about
starting a startup is that

900
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,240
you get no credit for
trying.

901
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,210
You only get points when you

902
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,460
make something that the
market wants.

903
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,770
So if you work really hard
on the wrong things.

904
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,510
Uh, no one will care.

905
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,610
So then there's this
question of how do

906
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,310
you figure out what to focus
on each day?

907
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,200
And this is where it's
really important to

908
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,820
have goals.

909
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,730
Most good founders that I
know uh,

910
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,930
at any given time have a
small number of

911
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,830
overarching goals for the
company.

912
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,060
Everybody in the company
knows.

913
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,920
Could be things like ship a
product by this date.

914
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,130
You know, maintain this
growth rate,

915
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,880
get this certain engagement
rate, hire for

916
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,690
these key roles, get this
deal done.

917
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,440
But anybody could tell you
in the company every week

918
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,560
what are our, what are our
key goals?

919
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,210
And then everybody executes
based off of that.

920
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,590
The founder really does set
the focus.

921
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,440
Um, whatever the founder
cares about,

922
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,800
whatever the founders think
are the key goals.

923
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,660
Um, that's going to

924
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,930
be what the whole company
focuses on.

925
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,560
And, and the best founders
repeat these goals over and

926
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,850
over far more often than
they

927
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,480
think they should need to.

928
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,450
They put em up on the walls,

929
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,880
they talk about them in one
on one's,

930
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,410
all hands meeting every
week.

931
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,820
Um, but it keeps the company
focused.

932
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,615
One of the keys to focus on
why I said I think.

933
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:09,610
Co-founders in different
places struggle is that

934
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,520
you can't be focused without
really great communication.

935
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,430
Um, even if you only have
say four or

936
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,850
five people in a company.

937
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,410
A small communication
breakdown is enough for

938
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,350
everybody to be working on
slightly different things.

939
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,030
Um, and then you lose focus
and

940
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,590
the company just scrambles.

941
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,260
I'm going to talk about this
a little bit more later.

942
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,900
Um, but growth and

943
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
momentum are something you
can never lose focus on.

944
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,340
Uh, growth and momentum are
what a start up lives on.

945
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,160
Uh, and you always have to
focus on maintaining these.

946
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,950
You should always know how
you

947
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,530
are doing against your
metrics.

948
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,710
You should have a weekly
review meeting every

949
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,990
week and you should be

950
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,120
extremely suspicious if
you're ever talking about.

951
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,170
We're not focused on growth
right now,

952
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,320
we're not growing that well
right now, but

953
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,220
we're doing this other
thing, you know.

954
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,010
We don't have, we don't have
a timeline for when we're

955
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,610
gonna ship this cuz were
focused on this other thing.

956
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,370
We're doing a rebrand,

957
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,150
whatever, almost always a
disaster.

958
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,120
So you wanna have the right
metrics and

959
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,210
you want to be focused on
growing those metrics and

960
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,300
having momentum.

961
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,610
Um, don't, don't let the
company get distracted or

962
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,250
excited by other things.

963
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,620
Um, a common mistake is that
company's gets excited by

964
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,130
their own PR.

965
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,970
It's really easy to get PR
with no results and

966
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,430
it feels like your actually
really cool.

967
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,350
But in a year, you'll still
have nothing, and

968
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,880
at that point you won't be
cool anymore.

969
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,750
And you'll just be

970
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,810
talking about these articles
from a year ago.

971
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,520
That oh, you know, like
these Standford students

972
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,320
start this new startup, it's
gonna be the next big thing.

973
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,840
And now you have nothing,
and that sucks.

974
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,970
Um, and then,

975
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,730
as I mentioned already, be
in the same space.

976
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,110
Ah, this is like,

977
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,640
I think this is pretty much
a non starter.

978
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,700
Remote co-founding teams is
just really really hard.

979
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,510
It slows down the cycle time
more

980
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,950
than anybody ever thinks
it's going to.

981
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:02,090
The other piece, besides
focus for

982
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,050
execution is intensity.

983
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,660
Um, startups only work at a
fairly intense level.

984
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,170
Um, a friend of mine says
that the secret to startups

985
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,890
is extreme focus and extreme
dedication.

986
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,300
You know you can like a have
a startup in one

987
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,320
other thing, you can have a
startup in a family but

988
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,380
you probably can't have many
other hobbies.

989
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,980
Startups are not the best
choice for

990
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,400
work life balance.

991
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,160
And that's sort of just, the
sad reality.

992
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,760
Um, there's a lot of great
things about a startup, but

993
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,020
this is not one of them.

994
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,100
Um, they are all consuming
in

995
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,330
a way that is difficult to
explain.

996
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,250
You, you generally need to

997
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,770
be willing to outwork your
competitors.

998
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,580
The good news here, uh, why
that's hard to see um, is

999
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,530
that a small amount of extra
work on the right thing.

1000
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,220
Makes a huge difference.

1001
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,540
One example that I like to
give is thinking about

1002
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,700
the viral coefficient for a
consumer web product.

1003
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,110
Um, how many users how many
new users each

1004
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,098
existing user brings in.

1005
00:36:57,098 --> 00:36:59,550
If it's .99 the company will

1006
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,600
eventually flatline and then
die.

1007
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,590
Uh, and if it's 1.01 you'll
be in this happy place of

1008
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,390
exponential growth forever.
