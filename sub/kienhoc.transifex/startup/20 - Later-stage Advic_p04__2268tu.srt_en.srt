901
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ZQ-rf6iIc
You have these wiggles of
false hope, and then finally,

902
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,410
finally, finally, things start
to grow.

903
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,610
Three years later.

904
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,530
So starting a startup ends up
being this very long process.

905
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,670
It is, you know, it can be
really rewarding.

906
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,480
It's definitely long, but it
is do-able.

907
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,330
And that's what I love about
that drawing.

908
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,580
So, with that, I think I have
about ten minutes left.

909
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,850
I can answer questions on
this, or

910
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,930
anything else in the course
that we've covered.

911
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:44,586
If anyone has some.

912
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:47,940
Yes.

913
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,140
>> You have that diversity
being important, but

914
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,570
an earlier speaker said
diversity wasn't important and

915
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,720
you should just hire people
that are very much like you,

916
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,610
and then you can cross.

917
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,270
>> So, here is the the
question is, how do you you

918
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,000
square the device of diversity
being important with earlier

919
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,030
speakers saying you want
people that are very similar.

920
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,920
the, the difference what you
want is you want diversity of

921
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,830
backgrounds, but you don't
want diversity of vision.

922
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,370
Like where companies get in
trouble is

923
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,540
when they have people think
very differently about what

924
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,400
the company should be doing,
or don't work well together.

925
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,570
You don't want that.

926
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,320
You do want to hire people
that you know, and

927
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,710
that you trust and that you
can work with.

928
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,630
But if everyone on the team
comes from exactly the same

929
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,300
background you end, you do end
up developing somewhat of

930
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,920
a mono-culture which often
causes problems down the road.

931
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,750
Not always.

932
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,290
Some companies have been
successful with that.

933
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,880
So what, what we tell people
is, hire people that you know

934
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,960
and that you've worked with
before.

935
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,910
But try to hi,

936
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,490
try to hire people that are
complementary and

937
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,160
align towards the same goal,

938
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,470
not people that are exactly
the same.

939
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,330
because you just get a, a
better skill set.

940
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,560
Yeah.

941
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,340
>> What are some examples of
ways to make a transition back

942
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,940
to a more personal level,
especially when you're really.

943
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,300
>>
>> How to keep track,

944
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,770
productivity systems.

945
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,960
So, the one I use, which
actually I think works really

946
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,830
well, is I keep one piece of
paper with my goals for

947
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,090
sort of a three to 12 month
time frame.

948
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,910
And I look at that every day.

949
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,600
And then separately I keep
one, one page for

950
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,310
every day of my short term
goals for that day.

951
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,400
And so if I need to do
something in like a week,

952
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,020
I just flip forward seven
pages and write it down, and

953
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,180
then I also keep a list of
every person and

954
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,640
what they're working on, and
what I need to tell them, and

955
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,550
what I need to talk to them
about,

956
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,990
what we talked about last
time.

957
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,725
So every time I sit down with
someone,

958
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,298
I kind of have the full
statement,

959
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:50,860
a list of things for that
person that works really well.

960
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,067
Yes.

961
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,296
>> So we talked about that
startup growing.

962
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:55,318
But most startups fail.

963
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,446
>> Yeah.
>> Any advice for

964
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:58,167
kind of fail gracefully.

965
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,844
>> Yeah.

966
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:03,141
>>
>> How to fail gracefully.

967
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:08,316
So, most startups fail,and
Silicon Valley almost goes

968
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:12,290
too far in how much it loves
failure.

969
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,210
Failure still sucks.

970
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,250
You should still try not to
fail.

971
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,600
And this whole, like, thing,

972
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,750
of like, failure's great, I, I
don't agree with.

973
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,130
But it will happen to most
people most of the time,

974
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,930
and it's a very forgiving
environment.

975
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,920
As long as you are upfront
about it, and

976
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,740
ethical, and don't let anyone
get into a bad situation.

977
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,880
So, if you're failing, first
of all,

978
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,700
you should tell your
investors.

979
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,250
And, second of all, you should
not totally run out of money.

980
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,580
What you don't want is a
blow-up with a bunch of, you

981
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,800
know, debts that the company
owe, and everyone, you know,

982
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,950
showing up to work, one day,
and the door being locked.

983
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,760
You'll know when you're
failing,

984
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,890
you'll know when the company
is,

985
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,450
things just aren't going to
work,

986
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,500
and you should just tell your
investors.

987
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,230
Like, hey, sorry, this isn't
going to work.

988
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,310
No one will be surprised.

989
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,330
Like, I expect to lose my, or
I'm willing to lose my money

990
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,120
on every investment I ever
make.

991
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,590
I know that happens most of
the time, and

992
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,540
the winners pay for it,

993
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,240
you know, still with a factor
of 100, so it's okay.

994
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:09,660
No one, people will be very
understanding and supportive.

995
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,530
But you want to tell people
early.

996
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,020
You don't want to surprise
them.

997
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,080
And you want, you don't
want to like

998
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,110
let your employees gets
shocked when they learn they

999
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,950
don't have a job.

1000
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,500
you know, you, you,

1001
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,460
you want to shut the company
down in a graceful way.

1002
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,380
Help them find jobs.

1003
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,430
Make sure you give them two or
four weeks of severance

1004
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,660
payment, so that they're not
suffering a cash flow problem.

1005
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,710
All that stuff is pretty
important.

1006
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,620
Yes.

1007
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,650
>> How many immigrant founders
have you seen in Y Combinator?

1008
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,180
>> How many immigrant founders
have we seen in Y Combinator?

1009
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,170
In the last batch, I think it
probably went up for

1010
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,020
this next batch, in the last
batch 41% of the founders we

1011
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,850
funded were born outside the
US.

1012
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,540
From 30 different countries.

1013
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,700
So it's.

1014
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,930
Yeah a pretty big percentage.

1015
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,199
>> What do you think are other
good places to

1016
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,220
start a start up?

1017
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,390
>> Apart from the Valley where
do I

1018
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,960
think are other good places to
start a start up?

1019
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,430
Well I still think the Valley
is

1020
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,030
the best by a very significant
margin.

1021
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,230
But I think it's finally,

1022
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,470
maybe beginning to weaken a
little bit.

1023
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,010
Because the costs have just
gotten so out of control.

1024
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:09,690
To be clear, if I

1025
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,720
was going to start a company I
still wouldn't think about.

1026
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,340
I would still pick Silicon
Valley.

1027
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,610
And I think if you look at the
data of companies over

1028
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,050
the last few years, Valley
still wins by a lot.

1029
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,320
But Seattle, LA, lots of

1030
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,560
places outside the U.S., I
think all of these make sense.

1031
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,360
>> Like what places outside?

1032
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,080
I hesitate to make
recommendations there

1033
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,400
because I haven't spent enough
time in

1034
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,851
this cities to really have an
intuitive feel.

1035
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,080
but, like, I mean, you, you
know as well as

1036
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,290
I do the common ones people
talk about, startup hubs,

1037
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,150
and I just, I can't make a
personal recommendation there.

1038
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:49,443
>> Hire a professional CEO or
like a senior.

1039
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:50,645
>> When should the founders
think about

1040
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:51,580
hiring a professional CEO?

1041
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,761
Never.

1042
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:57,222
you, if you look at the most
successful.

1043
00:41:57,222 --> 00:42:01,225
Companies in tech, they are
run by their founders for

1044
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:04,482
a very long time, sometimes
forever.

1045
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:07,130
And sometimes they even hire a
professional CEO and then

1046
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,020
realize that that is not going
to like build a great company.

1047
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:15,412
And so, like Larry Page came
back to CEO again.

1048
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:19,480
I think, if you don't want to
be the long-term CEO of

1049
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,260
a company, you probably
shouldn't start one.

1050
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,310
I'm not totally sure about
that.

1051
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,040
I think there are exceptions.

1052
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,380
But generally, that,

1053
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,100
the transition I talked about
today, if you go

1054
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,080
from building a great product
to building a great company.

1055
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,910
Being a founder, you know, for
nine of the ten years is going

1056
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,020
to be about building that
great company.

1057
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,860
And if you're, if you're not
excited about doing that I

1058
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,310
think you should think hard
about, about it.

1059
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,050
Yes?

1060
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,088
>> What are some of the most
common and

1061
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:50,400
most alarming warning signs
you should be looking for.

1062
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,650
When you're trying to make
this shift from

1063
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,289
building great products to
building great companies.

1064
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,590
What are the, the most common
mistakes to make when

1065
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,730
you're shifting towards
building your own company?

1066
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,910
I think I went through most of
them here.

1067
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,330
I tried to put everything in
here that I

1068
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,640
see people mess up most of the
time.

1069
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,530
Yes?

1070
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,340
>> Is there a way to get
involved in the Y com,

1071
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,310
community before getting
accepted?

1072
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,350
Is there a way to get involved
with YC before getting funded?

1073
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,510
No, and intentionally not.

1074
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,840
Actually I'll say the one
thing you can do is if you

1075
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,960
work at a YC company.

1076
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,820
And then later apply I think
that probably like,

1077
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,430
well not probably.

1078
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,440
That definitely if you get a
good recommendation from

1079
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,240
those founders will help with
YC.

1080
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,770
So you know, working at a YC
company helps.

1081
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,830
But there's not much you can
do to help and

1082
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,890
that's intentional.

1083
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,292
Like there is no pre start up
in a way that there's pre-med.

1084
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,042
You should just focus on
whatever you're doing.

1085
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,170
And when you start a start up,
there's things like YC and

1086
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,870
others that are structured to
help you.

1087
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,010
Most of the founders we fund,

1088
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,140
we don't know at all before we
do it.

1089
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,990
You know, you don't,

1090
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,670
you really don't need to get
to know us or get involved.

1091
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,620
We're, we're all good that
way.

1092
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,610
Yes?

1093
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,220
>> There's a statistic of
saying,

1094
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,450
now harder to get into Y
company then getting,

1095
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,420
getting into Harvard.

1096
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,960
So I'm curious, the criteria
that are used,

1097
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,910
think of start-up, does it
change over time, or?

1098
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,610
>> The question is what,

1099
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,880
what criteria do we use to
pick start-ups and

1100
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,620
has it gotten harder?

1101
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,190
Has it changed?

1102
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:25,760
You know, we, the two things
that we need to see are,

1103
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,190
are good founders and a good
idea.

1104
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,160
And without both of those, we,
we won't fund a company.

1105
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,210
But that hasn't changed.

1106
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,738
That has, that has always been
the case.

1107
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:39,330
The applicant pool to YC has
grown quite a bit.

1108
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,898
But most of, or a lot of the
growth is, you know,

1109
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:44,930
people that shouldn't be
starting start-ups anyway.

1110
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,106
Probably, that are just doing
it

1111
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:47,370
because it's sort of the cool
thing now.

1112
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,210
So you know, if you're really
passionate about an idea.

1113
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:51,910
And the idea is good.

1114
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,410
And you're you know, smart and

1115
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,410
get things done that you're
executing.

1116
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:58,400
I still think you have a, a
very reasonable shot at YC,

1117
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,812
even though the headline
number is bigger.

1118
00:45:00,812 --> 00:45:01,920
Yes.

1119
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,210
>> The certain, certain market
that you're really excited

1120
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,520
about but don't necessarily
know a lot about yet.

1121
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,420
Is there a certain or ways to
,.

1122
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,410
>> Sure.
If there's

1123
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,250
a market that you're excited
about but

1124
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,360
don't know a lot about yet,
what should you do?

1125
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,580
Two schools of thought on
this.

1126
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,160
One is to just jump right in.

1127
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:20,820
Learn it as you go.

1128
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,890
That's worked a lot of times.

1129
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,170
The other is to go work at a
company in the space or

1130
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,160
do something in, in the market
for,

1131
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,349
you know, a year or two years.

1132
00:45:30,372 --> 00:45:34,030
I lean slightly towards the
second.

1133
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:36,453
But as long as you're willing
to really learn and

1134
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,232
really study and really get
uncomfortably close to your

1135
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:40,840
users, either case will work.

1136
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,230
And I don't think it's that
much of a disadvantage.

1137
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,720
I, I think, all things being
equal,

1138
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,000
I would go spend a couple
years learning about it

1139
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,178
in detail, but I don't think
you have to.

1140
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:54,473
Yes?

1141
00:45:54,473 --> 00:45:57,780
>> I have question related to
YC to.

1142
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,700
>> Sure.
>> Yeah so,

1143
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,430
I think that YC does fantastic
job in promoting partnership,

1144
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,630
instead of combating.

1145
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,380
In fact, as an institutional
investor I actually I

1146
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,260
messed with a suite up at YC.

1147
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,666
In past periods, the hardware
has things like you know, you

1148
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:16,730
guys has 180 companies every
year jumping into the market.

1149
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,327
And it looks like it's hard to
follow each of the YC

1150
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:20,350
companies any more.

1151
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,170
Do you think that this will
create some you know,

1152
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,183
if some people will walk away
from YC.

1153
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:30,803
Because they cannot follow
such a companies.

1154
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:32,737
The company has to be very
polished and

1155
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:35,643
the founder has to be thinking
over and over about ideas.

1156
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:42,723
Easy to access the capital-

1157
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:44,739
>> All right, so I think the
question is do I think

1158
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:47,140
investors are going to fund
less YC companies as we grow?

1159
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:48,930
no.

1160
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,840
Definitely not.

1161
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,410
Like certainly the trend in
this is the other way.

1162
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,020
We have more and more
investors saying that,

1163
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,330
you know, half their
portfolio's now YC companies.

1164
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,160
And they're looking forward to

1165
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,021
the day where it's
three-quarters.

1166
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:00,740
No I don't think that's a
problem at all.

1167
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,000
I think that is like so not on
my top 100 problem list.

1168
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,210
The opposite of that maybe.

1169
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,010
All right, one more question.

1170
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:07,740
Yes.

1171
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,810
>> When should a group of
founders raise a seed fund or

1172
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,650
the first fund?

1173
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,250
>> When should a group of

1174
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,160
founders raise some seed
money?

1175
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,840
This is a great question.

1176
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,380
I think that, I think that in
general.

1177
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,390
It's nice to wait until you
have the idea figured out and

1178
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,510
initial signs of promise
before you raise money.

1179
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,050
Raising money puts some
pressure on the company.

1180
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,740
Some time pressure.

1181
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,710
And once you've raised money
you can't be in

1182
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,390
this exploratory phase
indefinitely.

1183
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,650
you, and you end up having to
rush.

1184
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,780
And so, like, if you haven't
raised money, and your idea's

1185
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,820
not working, you can, you
know, like flail around and

1186
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,110
pivot until you really hit on
the thing that's working.

1187
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,390
But if you raise money and
your idea doesn't work,

1188
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,051
you're in this like oh ****
moment, and you have to pivot.

1189
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:55,696
And you pivot to

1190
00:47:55,696 --> 00:47:58,560
whatever the first vaguely
plausible idea is.

1191
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,090
And that's bad.

1192
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,780
So I think.

1193
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,890
If you can wait to raise any
outside capital more than say,

1194
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:06,658
like $100 or

1195
00:48:06,658 --> 00:48:09,300
$200,000 if you're necessary,
but ideally not even that.

1196
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,670
Until things are working or,
or at least pointing in

1197
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,010
the direction of working
you're way better off.

1198
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,135
All right, thank you all very
much, this was fun.
