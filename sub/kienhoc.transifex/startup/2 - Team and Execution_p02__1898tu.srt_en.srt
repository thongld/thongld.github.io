253
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,010
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfnkM44Urs
One of those was that you
had to bleed Airbnb.

254
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,000
And if you didn't sort of
agree to

255
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,610
that they just wouldn't hire
you.

256
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,510
Um, as an example of how
intense Brian Chesky is,

257
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,100
he's there being CEO.

258
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,558
Um, he use to ask people
before he hired them at

259
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:18,130
Airbnb, if they would take
the job if they got a

260
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,050
medical diagnosis that they
got one year left to live.

261
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,350
Um, he wanted them to be
that committed.

262
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,980
Later he decided that, that
was like a little too crazy.

263
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,450
>> Um, and I think he
relaxed it to ten years.

264
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,689
But last I heard, he still
asks that question.

265
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,110
Um, but like, you know,
these hires really matter.

266
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,600
These people are what go on
to define your company.

267
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,270
And so you need people that
believe in it almost as

268
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,590
much as you do.

269
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,110
And it sounds like a crazy
thing to ask, but

270
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,120
he's gotten this culture of
extremely dedicated people.

271
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,220
Um, that come together when
the company faces a crisis.

272
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,870
Uh, and when the company
faced a big crisis early on,

273
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,510
everyone in the company
lived in the office, and

274
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,820
they shipped product
everyday until

275
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,640
the crisis was over.

276
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,820
One of the remarkable
observations about Airbnb is

277
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,120
if you talk to any of the
first,

278
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,860
say 40 or 50 employees, they
all

279
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,040
feel like they're apart of
the founding of the company.

280
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
Uh, and this is really hard
to get right and

281
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,890
this is really rare.

282
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,470
Um, but by having an
extremely high bar and

283
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,500
hiring slowly and

284
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,560
making sure everyone
believes in the mission,

285
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,070
you can get that.

286
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,980
Okay, so let's say, you
know,

287
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,630
you've listened to the
warning about not hiring and

288
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,700
now you absolutely have to.

289
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,460
When you're in this hiring
mode, your job is, it should

290
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,710
be your number one priority
to get the best people.

291
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,940
Just like when you are in
product mode that is

292
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,590
your number one priority.

293
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,870
And when you are in
fundraising mode,

294
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,710
fundraising's your number
one priority.

295
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,710
Um, one thing that founders
always estimate is how

296
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,710
hard it is to re recruit.

297
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,810
You know, you think you have
this great idea and

298
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,840
everyone's going to come and

299
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,100
join, but that's not how it
works.

300
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,240
To get the very best people
they have a lot of

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,000
great options, right?

302
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,160
And so it can easily take a
year to recruit someone.

303
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,750
It's this long process and
you have to convince them

304
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,280
that your mission is the
most important of

305
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,160
anything that they're
looking at.

306
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,200
This is another case of why
it's really important to

307
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,960
get the product right,
before anything else.

308
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
The best people know that

309
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,780
they should join a rocket
ship.

310
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,960
Um, by the way, that's my
number one piece of advice.

311
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,270
If you're gonna join a start
up, pick a rocket ship.

312
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,570
Um, pick a company that's
already working.

313
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,190
Uh, and that the,

314
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,960
you know, not everyone yet
realizes that.

315
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,630
But it's, you know,

316
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,290
you know cuz you're paying
attention and

317
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,310
it's going to be huge.

318
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,900
And, and again you can
usually identify these.

319
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,240
Um, but good people know
this, right?

320
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,060
And so good people will wait
and they want to see that

321
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,390
you're on this break out
trajectory before they join.

322
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,680
One question that people
asked online this morning

323
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,700
is, how much time you should
be spending hiring.

324
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,650
The answer is either like 0
or 25%.

325
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,780
You're either not hiring at
all, or

326
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,300
it's probably your single
biggest block of time.

327
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,910
Um, in practice, like all
these books on management or

328
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,160
whatever say that you

329
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,020
should spend 50% of your
time hiring.

330
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,970
But the people that give
that advice, it's rare for

331
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,485
them to even spend 10%
themselves.

332
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,310
25% is still a huge amount
of time.

333
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,440
Um, but that's really how
much you should be doing

334
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,300
once you're in hiring mode.

335
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,840
Um, okay, so if you
compromise and

336
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,950
hire someone mediocre, you
will always regret it.

337
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,680
We always like to warn
founders of this.

338
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,160
No one really feels it until
they miss,

339
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,850
make the mistake the first
time.

340
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,830
Um, but it can poison the
culture.

341
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,560
Mediocre people at a big
company cause some problems.

342
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,180
They don't usually kill the
company.

343
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,070
A single mediocre hire in
the first five will often,

344
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,000
in fact, kill a start up.

345
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
Uh, a friend of mine has a
sign up

346
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,810
in the conference unit, he
uses for interviews.

347
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,060
And he like positions the
sign, so

348
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,670
the candidate is looking at
it,

349
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,740
while they're interviewing.

350
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,950
And it says that mediocre
engineers do not

351
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,140
build great companies.

352
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,120
Um, yeah.

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,400
That's true.

354
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,450
Um, it's really true.

355
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,940
You can get away with it, in
a big company, right?

356
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,750
Cuz people just sort of
like,

357
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,110
fall through the cracks.

358
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,420
But, but every person in a
startup sets the tone.

359
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,590
Um, so if you compromise in
the first, you know,

360
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,470
say five, ten hires, um, it
might kill the company and

361
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,420
you should think about that
for

362
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,670
everyone you hire like will
I bet the future of this

363
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,660
company on the single hire
um, and that's a tough bar.

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,180
At some point in life at the
company when you're bigger,

365
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,090
you will compromise on a
hire um,

366
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,550
there'll be some pressing
deadline uh, or

367
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,810
something like that.

368
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,430
You will still regret it,
um, but

369
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,660
this is the difference
between theory and

370
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,570
practice, and we're gonna
have later speakers talk

371
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,010
about what this, what to do
when this happens.

372
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,220
But in the early days you
just can't screw it up.

373
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,940
Um, sources of candidates,

374
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,620
this is another thing that
students get wrong a lot.

375
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,572
Um, the best source by far
for

376
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,600
hiring, is people that you
already know, and

377
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,260
people that other employees
in the company already know.

378
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,770
Most great companies, in
tech have been built

379
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,190
by personal referrals, for
the first at least 100

380
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,910
employees and often many
more.

381
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,370
Um, most founders feel

382
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,770
awkward calling everyone
good that they ever met.

383
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,590
And asking their employees
to do the same.

384
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,850
But you'll notice that if
you go work at Facebook or

385
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,230
Google, one of the things
they do in your first few

386
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,380
weeks, is an HR person sits
you down, and like beats out

387
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,930
of you every smart person
you've ever met.

388
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,660
No matter how likely you

389
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,520
think you are to be able to
recruit them.

390
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,420
Um, and these personal
referrals really

391
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,230
are the trick to hiring.

392
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,760
So you have to

393
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,350
like go way beyond your
comfort zone here.

394
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,990
Um, another tip is to look
outside the valley.

395
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,260
It is brutally competitive
to hire engineers here.

396
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,310
Um, but you probably know
very good people living

397
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,300
elsewhere in the world that
would love to work with you.

398
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,250
Another question that
founders ask us

399
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,070
a lot about Is experience
and how much that matters.

400
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,710
Um, the short version here,

401
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,980
is that it experience
matters for some roles and

402
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,930
not others.

403
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,910
Um, when you're hiring sort
of like you know,

404
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,880
someone that is gonna run a
large organization of

405
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,870
your company, experience
probably matters a lot.

406
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,160
Um, for most of the early
hires you make in

407
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,300
a start up, experience
doesn't matter very much uh,

408
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,840
and you should go for

409
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,400
aptitude and believe in what
you're doing.

410
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,279
Most of the best hires that
I ever made in my

411
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,438
entire life have never done
that thing before.

412
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:54,060
Um, so it's really like is
this a role where I

413
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,858
care about experience or
not.

414
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,379
Most of the time you don't
in the, in the early days.

415
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,361
Um, there are three things
that I look for

416
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,332
when I hire people.

417
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:03,770
Um, are they smart?

418
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,070
Do they get things done?

419
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,980
Do I want to spend a lot of
time around them?

420
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,110
And if I get an answer, if
get, ended up with a yes for

421
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,170
all thee of these,

422
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,790
um I almost never regretted
a hire.

423
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,640
It's almost always worked
out.

424
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,950
You can learn a lot about
all three of

425
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,850
these things from an
interview.

426
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,100
But the very best way is by
working together.

427
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,600
So ideally,

428
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,670
it's someone you've worked
with in the past.

429
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,300
And in which case,

430
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,110
you probably don't even need
an interview.

431
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,910
Um, if you haven't, then I
think it's way

432
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,510
better to work with someone
on a quick project for

433
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,680
a day or two before hiring
them.

434
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,710
Um, you'll both learn a lot,
they will too.

435
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,790
And most uh,

436
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,070
first time founders are very
bad interviewers.

437
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,840
But very good at evaluating
someone after

438
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,180
they've worked together.

439
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,980
So one of the pieces that we
give advice,

440
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,910
one of the pieces of advice
that we give at YC is,

441
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,730
try to work together on

442
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,800
a project rather than just
doing an interview.

443
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,880
Um, if you are gonna
interview, which

444
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,950
you'll probably do as well,
you should ask specifically

445
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,880
about projects that someone
has done in the past.

446
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,020
Um, you'll learn a lot more
than you will with

447
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,840
brain teasers.

448
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,940
For some reason,

449
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,920
young technical founders
love to ask brain teaser

450
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,080
questions rather than just
ask what someone's done.

451
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,390
Really dig into projects
people have worked on and

452
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,420
call references.

453
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,880
Ah, that is another thing
that first time

454
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,300
founders like to skip.

455
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,800
Um, you want to call some
people uh,

456
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,710
that these people have
worked with in the past.

457
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,670
And then when you do,

458
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,350
you don't just want to ask
like how was so and so.

459
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,317
Like you really want to dig
in, like is this person in

460
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,530
the top 5% of people you've
ever worked with?

461
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,200
What specifically did they
do?

462
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,420
Would you hire them again?

463
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,070
Like why,

464
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,590
why, why aren't you trying
to hire them again?

465
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,740
Um, you really have to press
on,

466
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,639
on these reference calls.

467
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,720
Um, another thing that I've
noticed from talking to

468
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,290
a lot of YC companies,

469
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,210
is that good communication
skills tend to

470
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,720
correlate really well with
hires that work out.

471
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,190
Um, I used to not pay
attention to this.

472
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,110
We're gonna talk more about
why communication is so

473
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,680
important in an early
startup.

474
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,040
If someone is difficult to
talk to, if

475
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,710
someone cannot communicate
clearly uh, it's a real

476
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,519
problem in terms of their
likelihood to work out.

477
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,968
Also for early employees you
want people that have

478
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:06,726
somewhat of a risk taking
attitude.

479
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,293
Uh, you, you generally get
this or

480
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,237
they wouldn't be interested
in a startup.

481
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:14,053
But now that startups are
sort of more in fashion um,

482
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:17,176
you, you want people that
actually sort of

483
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,100
like a little bit of risk.

484
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,640
If someone's choosing
between like Mackenzie and

485
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,960
joining your startup, very
unlikely that,

486
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,270
that person's going to work
out at the startup.

487
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,560
Uh, you also want people who
are maniacally determined.

488
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,410
And that is slightly
different than

489
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,790
having a risk tolerant
attitude, so

490
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,900
you really should be looking
for both.

491
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,920
By the way, people are
welcome to

492
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,360
interrupt me with questions,
as stuff comes up.

493
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,480
There's a famous test from

494
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Paul Graham called the
Animal Test.

495
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,470
Um, and, and the idea here
is that you should be able

496
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,030
to describe any employee as
an animal at what they do.

497
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,760
Um, and I don't think that
probably translates out of

498
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,718
English very well, but

499
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:58,270
um, you know, you need
unstoppable people.

500
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,410
Uh, you want,

501
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,810
you want people that are
just going to get it done.

502
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,880
Um, founders that end up

503
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,670
being really happy with
their early hires.

504
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,870
Usually end up describing
these people as the very
