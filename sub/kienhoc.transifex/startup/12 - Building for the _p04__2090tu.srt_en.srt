874
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:42,938
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFVDjrvQJdw
Thank you.

875
00:34:42,938 --> 00:34:48,817
So basically PlanGrid is a
mobile application that

876
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:53,610
lets you manage construction
projects.

877
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,988
Lets you get access to your
blueprints, lets you manage

878
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:58,320
all of the data around a
construction process.

879
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,230
And what this team realized
was that $4 billion,

880
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,270
I believe, are spent every
year printing out blueprints

881
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,010
and making all of the
prints, and

882
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,896
updates to those blueprints
any time there's a change.

883
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,190
And then that has to ripple
and

884
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,830
cascade through a very wide
network of contractors and

885
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,170
construction people every
time that

886
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,208
there's even just one
slight, minute change.

887
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,646
And they realized that, you
know, with the iPad,

888
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:23,138
all of a sudden, we have the
perfect form vector to be

889
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:25,424
able to load up blueprints
and load up content.

890
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,568
And this is something that

891
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:28,804
could ripple through the
construction industry,

892
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:30,936
which isn't necessarily
notoriously known for

893
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:33,510
high technology, except for
on the design side.

894
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,980
How could they build
technology that would

895
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,580
make the data access, the
data collaboration problem

896
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,050
really, really seamless and
easy to do, in a very,

897
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,330
you know, traditional
industry that

898
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:46,590
hasn't quite changed for a
while.

899
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,800
So it was a sort of perfect,
sort of discovery of

900
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,280
a technology change in a
market and

901
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,780
figuring out how do those
two things converge.

902
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,100
And then this team built a
great startup out of it that

903
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,830
is doing incredibly well,
and totally taking over

904
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,576
the construction industry as
proven by this individual.

905
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:06,400
Thank you.

906
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:11,230
>> So the next thing is, in
the enterprise you want to

907
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,880
start intentionally small.

908
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,060
What I mean by that is, you
want to find, and

909
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,740
this is again, true of a lot
of companies, but

910
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,230
even more true in
enterprise,

911
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,150
in a user-led paradigm.

912
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,640
You want to find the wedge
that is sort of the very

913
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,000
natural place where you can
create a product that will

914
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,420
slip in between the gaps of
other existing products.

915
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,340
But is something that you

916
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,190
think over time expands to
become

917
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,140
a more important part of the
enterprise architecture.

918
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,140
So, what you want to start
to do is to say,

919
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,510
we're gonna take this sliver
of a problem,

920
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,680
we're going to totally make
the user experience on

921
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,010
that incredible.

922
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,990
We're gonna either change
the business model.

923
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,360
We're gonna create new
technology that makes this

924
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,210
previously difficult problem
really, really simple.

925
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,570
And it might feel small at
first.

926
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,170
Maybe you're going after
small businesses and

927
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,620
then you're gonna move
upmarket.

928
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,210
Maybe you're starting it
just a sliver of

929
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,170
the use case and then you're
gonna expand out.

930
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,500
But you intentionally start
small because you

931
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,550
will not be able to compete
with an incumbent.

932
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,190
Because the incumbent is
gonna always go for

933
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,320
the full solution.

934
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,280
So you have to find what are
the gaps in

935
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,600
the full solution that are
significant enough

936
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,620
where a customer is going to

937
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,810
want to solve the problem
with a discreet technology.

938
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,260
But that over time you're
gonna be able to expand,

939
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,435
again either to larger
customers or

940
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,600
to more use cases over time.

941
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,130
Great example is zenpayroll.

942
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,119
So zenpayroll, started by a
Stanford graduate or

943
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,580
Stanford graduates, couple
of years ago.

944
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,620
Basically discovered that
the payroll process in small

945
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,190
businesses is an incredibly
complicated and annoying and

946
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,370
cumbersome process.

947
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,710
And that's because we use
the same vendors that we've

948
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,470
been using for decades to do
that.

949
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,630
And they weren't sort of
digitally oriented.

950
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,750
You didn't get your payments
as a receipt, over email.

951
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,880
It was a very complicated.

952
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,970
You didn't really get to see
graphs of your salaries.

953
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,040
There was no real good data
around this.

954
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,530
And they said, we're just
gonna take

955
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,920
off the slice that is most
painful to startups around

956
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,820
hiring people and around
paying people,

957
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,840
which is just that payroll
management process.

958
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,160
We're going to plug into a
lot of

959
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,540
existing infrastructure, but

960
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,710
we're going to make it dead
simple to go do this.

961
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,630
And now they're able to move
both up market over time

962
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,890
as well as deliver new
services over time.

963
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,640
And what happens is the
incumbents in

964
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,110
this market initially look
at something like this and

965
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,810
payroll and they say, well,
that's small.

966
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,980
It's only for small
businesses.

967
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,450
It's not gonna be very
powerful.

968
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,900
But that's just the start.

969
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,540
Because as they get that
wedge and

970
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,020
as they fit into the market,

971
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,840
they're gonna be able to
expand again over time,

972
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,410
build out more services and
more capabilities.

973
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,330
But they found just the
exact right opening to build

974
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,149
a new company and have that
emerge.

975
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,550
The next is you really want
to find asymmetries.

976
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,710
You want to find, my God,
okay, so can we

977
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,660
do like some auto like some
tuning of a voice later so

978
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,490
at least it'll sound like
I'm doing rap.

979
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,001
{do things that incumbents
can't or

980
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,692
won't do because it's
economically or technically

981
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:06,417
infeasible} Okay, so you
want to be able to, you want

982
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:08,460
to do things that incumbents
can't or won't do.

983
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,280
Because, either the
economics don't make

984
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,170
sense for them.

985
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,640
Or the economics are so
different, or

986
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,400
so unusual or because
technically they can't.

987
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,850
I'll give you two examples.

988
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,071
So, if you're gonna build
software today for

989
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:24,788
the enterprise that goes
after an incumbent category

990
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:27,854
that has more of a sweet
oriented approach.

991
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:30,063
Then what you wanna go do,
is you wanna build

992
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,960
technology that's gonna be
platform agnostic.

993
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,210
Because what sweet players
will do, is they

994
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,460
want everything to be
integrated with itself and

995
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,330
that there's more value with
that vertical integration.

996
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,550
But you wanna go after a
different access, which is,

997
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,480
you want your technology to
work across all of

998
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,670
the platforms.

999
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,610
So that way, you can work
with so

1000
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,330
many different kinds of
customers, and

1001
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,810
you can be an ally to so

1002
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,370
many different kinds of
platforms,

1003
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,250
which a traditional
incumbent is not able to do.

1004
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,460
So that's something that is

1005
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,810
usually technically
infeasible, because of

1006
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,550
how either something has
been architected.

1007
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,430
Or because the fundamental
component of

1008
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,030
the business model to not do
that as the incumbent.

1009
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,800
But, the other thing is try
and

1010
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,230
do things that are
economically infeasible.

1011
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,620
You can look at the cost
structure of

1012
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,630
an incumbent company and
discover where are they

1013
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,010
not going to be able to drop
their prices.

1014
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,370
Because that business model
is fundamental to

1015
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,300
the existence of the
company.

1016
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,180
Or where can you find ways
of monetizing the customer

1017
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,802
that are unusual or

1018
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,312
unique, that no one has
discovered before.

1019
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,500
And thus is really not
practical for

1020
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,800
anyone else to do.

1021
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,110
That's a company called
Zenefits, where they have

1022
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,010
an HR management software
company that helps you,

1023
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,220
as a small startup,

1024
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,940
manage all of your benefits,
all of your HR information.

1025
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,830
And instead of charging the
startup, which might not

1026
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,530
value that software at the
stage that they're at.

1027
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,820
They realized that they
could get

1028
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,690
commission from the
insurance companies.

1029
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,710
And that basically pays for

1030
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,450
the ability to use their
software.

1031
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,030
So, the customer itself is
not paying for

1032
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,900
Zenefits, the Zenefits
platform is being paid for

1033
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,815
by the insurance company.

1034
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:08,874
And they've thus invented a
business model,

1035
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:10,932
that no other software
company has been able to

1036
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:11,848
think of or attack.

1037
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,653
And they're equally going
and

1038
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:16,431
disrupting a category that
hasn't seen a lot of

1039
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,279
innovation previously, which
is the health and

1040
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:22,137
benefit space within small
businesses.

1041
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:25,504
The next is you wanna find
the really crazy but, but

1042
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,873
sort of still somewhat
reasonable outliers within

1043
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:31,070
the customer ecosystem.

1044
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,180
So you need to find the
customers that are sort of

1045
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,730
at the edge of their
business, or

1046
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,690
at their business model, or
of their industry.

1047
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,770
And find the unique
characteristics about those

1048
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,020
customers, and leverage them
as your early adopters.

1049
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,810
So Paul Graham has a great
article, where he

1050
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,000
talks about living in the
future and building for

1051
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,460
what is missing when you're
living in the future.

1052
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,050
So that's a sort of easy way
to spot trends and

1053
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,750
patterns about disruption
that's playing out.

1054
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,920
The same is true in the work
place.

1055
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,990
If you find customers that
are working in the future,

1056
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,040
you will be able to work
with them to find what is

1057
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,480
missing when you're working
in the future.

1058
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,310
And how we build technology
that supports all these new

1059
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,410
use cases that are going to
emerge.

1060
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,170
There's a company called
Skycatch,

1061
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,710
which does enterprise
drones.

1062
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,500
And at first it seems kind
of weird, but

1063
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,260
in the construction space,
in farming, in oil and

1064
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,990
gas, they're using drones
now for data capture, and

1065
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,910
the ability to do modeling
of,

1066
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,300
of different environments.

1067
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,147
And so, this company is able
to find all of the companies

1068
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:34,873
that are at the bleeding
edge of their industry, what

1069
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:37,797
is unique or new about how
those organizations operate.

1070
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:40,721
And they built and worked
with a lot of those early

1071
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:44,144
adopters to establish their
platform, which is again,

1072
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:47,370
really one of the first
enterprise drone companies.

1073
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,050
So the idea is go look at
your market.

1074
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,684
Find the customers that are
at the bleeding edge of

1075
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:55,317
the market, who use
technology to get ahead, and

1076
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:58,027
that use technology for
performance advantages.

1077
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:01,153
And then go work with them
to discover how your product

1078
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:02,220
can evolve.

1079
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,280
Two minutes.

1080
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:04,880
Okay.

1081
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,769
Good.
Right, so.

1082
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:08,207
The next one is.
And

1083
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,867
then there's a part two in
five minutes from now, or

1084
00:43:10,867 --> 00:43:12,360
is that not the case?

1085
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,540
Okay, so, listen to your
customers, but

1086
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,720
don't always build exactly
what they're telling you.

1087
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,590
This is a really key

1088
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,390
distinction around building
enterprise software.

1089
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,700
Your customers are gonna
have a large number of

1090
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,510
requests.

1091
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,520
Your job is to distill those
requests down

1092
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,940
into the ultimate product.

1093
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,430
That does not mean that
you're going to

1094
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,500
build exactly what they tell
you to build.

1095
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,150
It is your job to listen to
their problems, but

1096
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,190
actually translate those
into what is going to build

1097
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,360
the best and simplest
solution to those problems.

1098
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,570
It's really your job, and
Palantir does this,

1099
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,180
as an example, with very,
very complex issues.

1100
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,410
And then they distill those
down into simple solutions

1101
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,430
for very, very,

1102
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,120
complex problems that the
customer otherwise would not

1103
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,830
have known how to ask for

1104
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,530
You want to modularize, not
customize.

1105
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,459
So build a platform, as
opposed to building all of

1106
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:04,742
the custom technology and
custom vertical experiences

1107
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,188
directly in the software
itself.

1108
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:09,080
Make sure that you really
think about openness in

1109
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,120
APIs as a way of delivering
vertical or

1110
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,320
custom experiences.

1111
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,500
Don't build that directly
into the product.

1112
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,420
Focus on the user always.

1113
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,616
So, again, the magical thing

1114
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,388
about building an enterprise
software company right now.

1115
00:44:21,388 --> 00:44:23,790
Is you can keep consumer DNA
at the center of

1116
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,010
the product.

1117
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,512
That will always mean that
adoption is easier.

1118
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:29,160
Your product has a much
higher chance of

1119
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,200
going viral.

1120
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,590
It becomes easier to sell
into the organization.

1121
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,600
So always make sure you
bring consumer DNA

1122
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,550
into the product development
process.

1123
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,373
And your product should sell
itself, but

1124
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,980
that does not mean you don't
need sales people.

1125
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,950
So this is a really
important distinction.

1126
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,050
Leverage everything about
the internet, leverage

1127
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,210
everything about users to
get to your customers.

1128
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,120
But you still will likely
need sales as a way to

1129
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,400
help your customers navigate
your product.

1130
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,730
Help your customers navigate

1131
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,400
the competitive landscape
and the ecosystem.

1132
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,464
So you're going to want
consultative, very,

1133
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:04,376
very domain-oriented sales
individuals,

1134
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:07,669
that are gonna be able to be
helpful in your customer

1135
00:45:07,669 --> 00:45:11,136
being deployed and enabled
in these organizations.

1136
00:45:11,136 --> 00:45:13,380
But don't make that be a
substitute.

1137
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,924
Do not make that be a
handicap for

1138
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,380
not building a great
product.

1139
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,200
So you fundamentally have to

1140
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,710
keep the product at the
center of that.

1141
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,420
Company called Mixed Panel
comes in through

1142
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,670
the developer, and then over
time is able to sell to that

1143
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,700
organization with a more
inside sales-led process.

1144
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,425
Also read these three books.

1145
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:32,930
So Crossing the Chasm,
Innovators Dilemma, and

1146
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,970
Behind the Cloud.

1147
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,220
These three combined,
especially if you read,

1148
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,510
if you binge and you just
read them all.

1149
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:39,260
You'll definitely come out

1150
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,370
the other end with a massive
software company.

1151
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,802
And so, in closing today.

1152
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:48,850
Right now,when you leave
this room, is an amazing

1153
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,730
time to go start an
enterprise software company.

1154
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,340
So I wish you the best of
luck.

1155
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,490
And of course, if it doesn't
work, we are hiring.

1156
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,540
So, and then the only other
caveat is please do

1157
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,630
not compete with me.

1158
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,560
Because I have a lot of
competition already.

1159
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,280
So ideally either come work
for us, or

1160
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,540
build your own company.

1161
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,510
So thank you very much.
