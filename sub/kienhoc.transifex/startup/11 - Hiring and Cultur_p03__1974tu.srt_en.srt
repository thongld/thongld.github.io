515
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,180
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Dl8rZ6qwE
And so, for

516
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,120
a majority, maybe in all of
the first ten people,

517
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,680
we worked with them in some
capacity.

518
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,480
Usually for a week in
advance, and

519
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,777
it's pretty hard to fake it
for a week.

520
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,020
It tends to be pretty clear,
quite quickly.

521
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,840
And another thing I thought
of you know, to the question

522
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,830
of sort of how do you know
like who is great or

523
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,870
who is good enough or
whatever.

524
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,740
And people always talk about
this notion of

525
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,350
the ten x person, that
whatever that skill set is.

526
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,210
I don't really know what ten
x means,

527
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,550
I think maybe the slightly
more kind of helpful or like

528
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,180
intuitive version of that
is, is this person probably,

529
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,090
the best out of all of their
friends at what they do.

530
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,600
And so you know, it's a
little bit sensitive to you

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,290
know, how well they chose
friends, how many they have.

532
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,150
But for me at least, I find
that kind of

533
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,550
a more helpful way to think
about it, like

534
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,209
is this the best engineer
this engineer knows.

535
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,230
And the other thing I

536
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,570
think that's actually
probably just worth

537
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,320
mentioning in all of those
kind of first ten people, or

538
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,550
even more generally on the
culture and hiring topic.

539
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,650
I think everyone sort of
doesn't realize until they

540
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,620
go through it themselves how
it important it is,

541
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,210
in large part because the,
like in life and the media

542
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,580
and everything, people focus
way too much on founders.

543
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,780
And they're like, here we
are.

544
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,430
And so kind of,

545
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,760
we're re-enforcing the sort
of structural narrative that

546
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,660
like, stripe is about John
and Patrick.

547
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,510
And Pinterest is about Ben
and so forth.

548
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,830
Whereas, I mean, obviously,

549
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,320
sort of the vast majority of
what our companies do

550
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,860
like 99.9% is being down by
people who are not us.

551
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,490
Right?

552
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,930
And I think, I mean, that's
kind of,

553
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,410
it's obvious when you say
it, but it's at a very much,

554
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,840
not just the macro narrative
and

555
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,970
you know, companies are
abstract.

556
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,670
So you kind of need to
associate them with people.

557
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,230
But I think it's worth
bearing in mind that like

558
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,010
for, you know, Apple, you
know everything was

559
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,840
you know, Steve Jobs was a
like tiny, tiny detail at

560
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,240
the end, right, or Google
was that way, and so forth.

561
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,590
>> So don't screw it up, is
that what you're saying?

562
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,430
>> Something like that.

563
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,870
>> I think, you know, one
other thing I'll mention is

564
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,360
that I think referencing
people is really important,

565
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,270
and referencing people is
just what it sounds like.

566
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,780
You're basically asking
people who have real,

567
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,890
material working experience,
for their honest opinion.

568
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,220
And we do that really
aggressively, and

569
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,740
what we're trying to

570
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,900
figure out is what's this
person like to work with?

571
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,070
We're not trying to validate
like whether they

572
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,260
told the truth on their
resume,

573
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,400
cuz we assume that they're
telling the truth.

574
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,740
So, very standard questions
that I'll ask somebody who's

575
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,460
in an interview, I might
say, hey,

576
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,500
we both know Jonathan in
common.

577
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm gonna talk to him, you
know,

578
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,090
in a couple weeks, cause
we're both social friends.

579
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,560
Like if I asked him, what
you're the best at, or

580
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,690
what you would be most proud
of, or

581
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,230
what you were kind of
working to improve.

582
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,770
What would he or she say?

583
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,760
Because it sort of tests the
level of self awareness, and

584
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,900
creates a bit of social
accountability.

585
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,550
And then I'll try to ask
something that makes the

586
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,170
question which is typically
very soft feel a little bit

587
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,300
more quantitative, and then
calibrate that over time.

588
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,890
So you know,

589
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,680
in evaluating this person or
this dimension, do you think

590
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,110
this is the top 1% of people
you've ever worked with?

591
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,090
The top 5% and the top 10%?

592
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,410
And it forces a scarcity
that gives a materially

593
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,110
different reference, then if
you just say hey,

594
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,060
like what's the best thing
about John?

595
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,680
He told me you know, he's
good at these things.

596
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,250
Can you validate?

597
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,840
And you're like yeah,

598
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,220
sure, Cuz they don't gain
anything.

599
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,132
So I think that's just a
tool that people should

600
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:43,920
take seriously.

601
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,559
>> Yeah.

602
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,149
>> Yeah, and

603
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:48,168
referencing isn't obviously
easy to begin with, but

604
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:51,400
it does actually prove
really useful over time.

605
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,160
And you just have to, people
I think especially for

606
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,350
named references, people
really want to be nice.

607
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,370
So you have to do things
like create an artificial

608
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,600
scarcity by saying you know,
where would you rank this

609
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,230
person amongst the people
you worked within this role?

610
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,780
Or, you know,

611
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,730
you just splitz out on the
enchant of how to reference,

612
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,630
but usually I aim to spend,
you know,

613
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,470
15 minutes on the phone with
that person.

614
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,520
Not just let them say, yeah
this person is awesome, and

615
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,720
then hang up.

616
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,190
>> That's also a tremendous
source of new recruits.

617
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,800
>> Yeah.

618
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,530
>> Those references are also
a tremendous source of

619
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,120
new recruits.

620
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,690
What have each of you
learned about,

621
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,770
once you hire these first
people and they joined?

622
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,300
What have you done to make
them effective quickly?

623
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,280
To get them sort of, you
know,

624
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,190
to the right cultural place,
you know?

625
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,600
Cuz sort of hiring is
usually very difficult, but

626
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,430
then not as difficult as
making them

627
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,150
happy and effective.

628
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,860
So what do you do

629
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,500
with these early employees
to accomplish that?

630
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,860
>> Well, ways that it's
changed when we've gone from

631
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,790
really small to bigger.

632
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,800
When we first started,

633
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,970
we were generally hiring
because we needed

634
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,700
that person, like, a long
time ago.

635
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,090
And so their whole
on-boarding was like,

636
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:57,690
here's your computer,

637
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,880
we already set up your
environment,

638
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,500
don't worry about it,

639
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,690
this is the problem that we
have to solve together.

640
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,810
And then because of the
nature of the start ups,

641
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,380
we were all in this, like,
tiny, two bedroom apartment.

642
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,760
All of the other things,

643
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,250
like building personal
relationships,

644
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,680
spending time together,
getting to know one another,

645
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,810
it just all happened.

646
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,990
Kind of automatically like,

647
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,145
you didn't have to do
anything.

648
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:19,730
The one thing that I would
add to that is, though,

649
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,420
we would always try to
remind people of like,

650
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,600
where we wanted to go some
day.

651
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,370
Cuz it's really easy when
you first join to drop

652
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,380
somebody into a problem, and
then they think the whole

653
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,520
world is like this little
problem in front of them.

654
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,080
We'd always say,

655
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,320
you know, hey, some day we
wanna do for

656
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,830
Discovery what Google did
for search.

657
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,300
This is our plan for trying
to get that done.

658
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,690
Now as the company, grows I
think that process has to

659
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,300
get a little bit more
formalized.

660
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,660
And so we spend a lot of
time thinking, and honestly

661
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,770
trying to constantly refine
what is that person's

662
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,560
experience look like from
the day they came in,

663
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,240
to their very first
interview,

664
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,960
through 30 days after they
joined.

665
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,590
Like do they have somebody
whose name they know?

666
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,730
Do they know who their
manager is?

667
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,100
Have they sat down with
people on their team?

668
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,070
Do they know what the
general architecture of

669
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,700
the company is, and what the
top priorities are?

670
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,390
And we have a program and
it's a week long, and

671
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,370
then there are some function
specific programs that

672
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,740
go in deeper.

673
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,638
And that's something that's
always been refined.

674
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,190
And the alpha metrics that
we look on that,

675
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,400
it's when we ask people like
what did you think

676
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,090
afterwards and then 30 days
afterwards.

677
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,030
And then we also ask their
peers and their manager,

678
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,330
like hey, is this person
kind of up to speed?

679
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,090
Do you feel like we've done

680
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,290
a good job making them
productive?

681
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,330
And if we haven't, that's a
key A, that, that team

682
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,760
shouldn't be hiring anymore
people, because they're not

683
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,720
doing a good job bringing in
new people.

684
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,655
And B, that we need to
retool that.

685
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,520
And so I think those things
are important.

686
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,450
I just wouldn't discount
just how important it is to

687
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,380
get to know the person as a
person.

688
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,840
Like what are their
aspirations?

689
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,730
What's their working style?

690
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,250
How do they like to be
recognized?

691
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,810
Do they really prefer being
in total silence?

692
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,070
Are they a morning person or
night person?

693
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,400
Like knowing those things I
think, it just

694
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,270
demonstrates that you care
about them individually as

695
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,320
well as collectively, like
what you goals are.

696
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,540
>> I think there are two
things that are important at

697
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,680
any stage through the
implementation of a change.

698
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,330
The first is to get them up
and

699
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,480
running, doing real work
quickly.

700
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,560
Because that's only when you
can find the problems,

701
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,110
that's how progress is
measured,

702
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,340
is how much real work
they're doing.

703
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,000
And so, you know, when we
have engineers start,

704
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
we'll try to get them
committing on the first day.

705
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,620
When we have people you
know,

706
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,150
people in business roles
start,

707
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,750
we will have them in real
meetings on the first day,

708
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,390
on what they're meant to be
working on.

709
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,260
But I think sometimes
there's a tendency to

710
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,430
be tentative, and help ease
people in.

711
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,930
We're much more of the push
people off the cliff school.

712
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,820
And then I think the second,
is to try and

713
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,690
start quickly giving people
feedback, and

714
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,710
especially feedback on how
to adapt to the culture.

715
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,020
Because when you think about
it, like, you know,

716
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,490
if you have built a strong
culture as, you know,

717
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,310
all the companies up here
are trying to,

718
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,080
then it's going to take some
adapting for the person.

719
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,210
It's not going to be
necessarily easy, you know?

720
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,150
One thing we have at Stripe,

721
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,210
is just the culture was a
lot more written.

722
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,050
And so, you know?

723
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,480
You have people who are
right next to

724
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,790
each other each with
headphones on, and

725
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,360
just like IM'ing away to
each other.

726
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,170
And for you know,

727
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,490
a lot of people coming in
who hadn't worked in

728
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,210
an environment like that,
it's, it's sort of hard.

729
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,050
>> In normal places.

730
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:12,680
>> Exactly.
Yeah.

731
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,520
And so, everything from kind
of high level how you're

732
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,780
doing at your job, to kind
of minor cultural pointers.

733
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,530
The more feedback you can
give them,

734
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,440
the better they'll do.

735
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,150
And it's unnatural.

736
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,660
Right?
Because it's

737
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,850
unnatural to be constantly
telling people that

738
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:28,980
they're doing a good or bad
job.

739
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,870
You don't do that,
hopefully,

740
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,210
in your normal life, you're
more restrained.

741
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,570
But when you have employees,

742
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,470
that's kind of what you owe
them for them to do well.

743
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,170
>> So I think this is sort
of a good transition too,

744
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,609
as your companies have
scaled.

745
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,420
What are the biggest changes
you've had to make to your

746
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,560
hiring processes?

747
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,140
And also how you sort of
manage and

748
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,020
run the team, as you've gone
from, you know,

749
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,980
two to 10 to 100 to 1000
employees?

750
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,950
>> There a lot of changes.

751
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,550
I mean, I think one thing
that we try to do on

752
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,040
the team side is, the goal
is to make the teams feel as

753
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,130
autonomous and nimble as
possible within

754
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,140
the constraints of having a
large organization.

755
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,020
And that means over time,
that we're always trying to

756
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,430
make it feel like a start-up
of of many start-ups,

757
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,690
rather than this monolithic
organization with a set of

758
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,170
foreign processes that cut
horizontally through it.

759
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,290
And it's easier said than
done.

760
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,280
I think that, like we're not
all the way there.

761
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,830
But one of our goals is that
each team has, they control

762
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,772
the resources that they need
to get things done,

763
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:32,960
they know what the most
important thing is, and

764
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,150
how it's measured.

765
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,320
And in that way,

766
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,490
then the management problem
becomes somewhat tractable,

767
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,410
otherwise it feels
completely impossible if

768
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,610
you can't decompose it into
autonomous units.

769
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,609
Like you just look at it,
and you're like, oh my gosh,

770
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:45,752
communication complexity is
increasing geometrically.

771
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:46,810
Management complexity,
