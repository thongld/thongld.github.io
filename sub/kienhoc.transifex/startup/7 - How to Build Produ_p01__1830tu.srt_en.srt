1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,110
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_LgBAGYyo
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,080
So when I talk about making
products users love what I

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,050
mean specifically is like
how do we make things that

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,800
has a passionate user base
that our users

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,950
are unconditionally wanting
it to

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,590
be successful both on the
products that we build, but

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,960
also the companies behind
them.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
We're gonna go over tons of
information.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,260
Try not to take too many
notes,

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,290
mostly just try to listen.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,750
I'll post the link to the
slides on my Twitter account

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,470
and on that link, there will
be a way for you to

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,570
annotate the slide and you
can ask me questions.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,840
And so if we don't get to
them,

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
I'll answer them after the
talk.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,840
So, you guys have been.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,480
Listening to and

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,030
hearing a lot about growth
over the last several weeks,

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,050
and to me I feel like growth
is usually fairly simple.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,410
It's the interaction between
two sort of concepts or

21
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,450
variables.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,430
Conversion rate and churn.

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,100
Right?

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,950
And the gap between those
two things pretty

25
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,920
much indicate how fast
you're gonna grow.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,190
And most people, especially
business type people,

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,290
tend to look at this
interaction in terms of

28
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,980
a very calculated in a
mathematical sort of way.

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,070
And today, I sort of want to

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,180
talk about these things at a
more human scale.

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,720
All right, cuz at start up
when you're interacting with

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,700
your users, you have a
fairly intimate

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,010
interaction that you have in
the early stages.

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,020
And so, I think there's a
different way of looking at

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
this stuff in terms of how
we build our products.

36
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,080
And we'll look at a lot of
different examples of that.

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,190
And how it's executed well.

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,030
My philosophy behind a lot
of things that I teach

39
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,430
startups is the best way to
sort of get to a billion

40
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,000
dollars is to focus on the
values that help you

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,870
get that first dollar, to
acquire that first user.

42
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,080
If you sort of get that
right everything else will

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,270
sort of take care of itself.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,190
It's a sort of faith thing.

45
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,770
So I came to be a partner at
YC by way of being alumni.

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,800
I went to the program in
winter of 2006, so

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,890
it's the second ever program
and

48
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,420
I built a product called
Wufoo.

49
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,050
Wufoo's an online forum
builder.

50
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,830
It helps you create contact
forums and

51
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,170
online surveys and simple
payment forms.

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,350
It's basically a database
that looks like it's

53
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,090
designed by Fisher Price.

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,810
What's.

55
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,450
Interesting, though, is that
because it was fairly easy

56
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,290
to use, we're had customers
from every industry, market,

57
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,710
and vertical you can think
of, including a,

58
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,270
a majority of the Fortune
500 companies out there.

59
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,430
Ran the company for five
years, and

60
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,070
then we were acquired by
SurveyMonkey in 2013.

61
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,420
And at the time,

62
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,500
we were a very interesting
acquisition.

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,460
We were only a team of ten
people at the time.

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,680
And, while we acquired
funding out here in

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,820
Silicon Valley through Y
Combinator we actually ran

66
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,420
the company from Florida.

67
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,330
We had no office.

68
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,470
Everyone worked from home.

69
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,160
And we're an interesting
outlier.

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,940
So, each dot here represents
a start up that was,

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,400
that exited through IPO or
acquisition.

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
And we're this outlier to
the left.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,690
The bottom is the funding
amount they took.

74
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,530
And the vertical axis is,

75
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,440
the valuation of the company
at the time.

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,170
To sum it up,

77
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,685
the average startup rates as
about $25 million.

78
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,930
And they return to their
investors about 676%.

79
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,440
Wufoo raised about $118
thousand total.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,083
And our return to our
investors is about 29,000%.

81
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,810
>> So a lot of people were
very interested.

82
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,800
And are sort of like.

83
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,395
What makes.

84
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,510
Wufoo a little bit different
or

85
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,590
how do we run the company
very differently, and

86
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,910
a lot of it was focused on
product.

87
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,648
We weren't interested in
building software that,

88
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:28,910
I guess that just people
wanted to use.

89
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,070
Right.
That reminding you that you

90
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,990
worked in a cubicle,

91
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,560
cuz it was database app at
its sort of core.

92
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
We wanted a product that
people wanted to love.

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,600
That people wanted to have a
relationship with, and we

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,920
were actually very fanatical
about how we approached.

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,570
This idea.

96
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,930
At the point where it's
almost sort of

97
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,730
sort of sciency sort of way.

98
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,440
So what we said was like
Okay.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,030
What's interesting about
start-ups in terms of

100
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,580
us wanting to create things
that people love is that,

101
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,930
love and unconditional sort
of feelings are things that

102
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,919
are difficult for us to do
in sort of real life.

103
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,580
And at start-ups we have to
do it sort of at scale.

104
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,590
So we've decided to do is

105
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,510
just start of by just
looking at, Okay,

106
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,750
how does real relationships
work in the real world, and

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,390
how can we apply them to
sort of how we

108
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,630
run our business and sort of
build our product that way.

109
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,040
So we'll go over basically
these two metaphors,

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,190
find new users as if we're
trying to date them and

111
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,520
existing users as if it were
a successful marriage.

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,460
So when it comes to dating,
lot of the stuff that

113
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,630
we uncovered had to do with
first impressions.

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,270
all, all of you often talk
about your relationships in

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,440
terms of the origin story.

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,950
If I asked you to tell me
about the first kiss,

117
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,760
how you sort of met, how you
proposed,

118
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,530
these are the things that we
say over and

119
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,250
over and over again.

120
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,580
They're basically the
word-of-mouth stories of our

121
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,590
relationships, and they're
the same kinds of

122
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,990
things that we do with
companies.

123
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,560
Human beings

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,260
are relationship
manufacturing creatures.

125
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,440
We cannot help, but create
and anthropomorphize

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,590
the things we interact with
over and over again.

127
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,200
So, whether it's the cars we
drive,

128
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,220
the clothes we wear, the
tools and software's we use,

129
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,470
we eventually prescribe
characteristics to it.

130
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,250
A personality.

131
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,570
And we expect it to behave a
certain way.

132
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,350
And that's how we sort of
interact with it.

133
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,140
Now first impressions are
important for

134
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,760
the starting of any
relationship,

135
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,420
because it's the one we tell
over and over again.

136
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,960
Right?

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,710
And there's something
special about how we

138
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,910
regard that origin story.

139
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,300
I'll give an example.

140
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,100
If you're on a first date
with somebody,

141
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,090
and you're having a nice
dinner, and

142
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,510
you catch them picking their
nose.

143
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,930
You are probably not gonna
have another date with them.

144
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,440
Right, but if you're married
to someone for

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,130
about 20 to 30 years,

146
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,560
and you catch on the Barca
Lounger digging for

147
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
gold right?

148
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,380
You don't immediately like
call your lawyer,

149
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,660
right, and then say like we
have a problem here.

150
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,310
I need to start drawing up
papers for divorce.

151
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,850
You shrug your shoulders and

152
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,510
say at least he has a heart
of gold.

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,470
So solving about.

154
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,740
First time interactions
means that the threshold is

155
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,150
so much lower in terms of
pass fail.

156
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,590
So, in software, and for

157
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,250
most products in internet
software that we use, like,

158
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,290
first impressions are pretty
obvious.

159
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,420
And they're the things that
you see a lot of

160
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,890
companies sort of pay
attention to in terms of

161
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,410
what they send their
marketing people to work on.

162
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,830
My argument for people who
are very good at product is

163
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,030
they discover so many other
first moments, and

164
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,890
they make those something
memorable.

165
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,100
Right, the first email you
ever get from a piece of

166
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,760
software.

167
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,090
What happens when you first
log in?

168
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,480
The links, the advertising,
the very first time you

169
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,730
interact with customer
support.

170
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,940
All of those are
opportunities to seduce.

171
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,890
So how did we think about.

172
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,850
Sort of like making first
moments on there,

173
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,610
and we actually took this
concept from the Japanese.

174
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,120
They actually have two words
for

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
how to describe things when
you're finished with them

176
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,540
in terms of saying like is
this a quality item.

177
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,396
And the two words of quality
are atarimae hinshitsu and

178
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:48,290
miryokuteki hinshitsu.

179
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,470
And the first one means,
taken for

180
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,200
granted quality, basically
functionality.

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
And the last one sort of
means,

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,550
enchanting quality, right?

183
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,750
Take for example a pen,
right?

184
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,170
Something has miryokuteki,
right, if the weight of

185
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,220
the pen, the way the ink
flows out of it, the way

186
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,960
it's viewed by the people
reading the handwriting from

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,020
the pen is pleasurable both
to the user of the pen and

188
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,110
the people who experience
the byproducts of it,

189
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,840
right, taking it to the sort
of next level.

190
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,150
Start with some examples.

191
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,430
So this is Wufoo's Login
link, and

192
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,280
it has a dinosaur on it,
which I think is awesome.

193
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,080
But if you hover over it,

194
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,060
the spec has the added
benefit of having a tool tip

195
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,690
that doesn't explain like
how to login or

196
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,260
what it does, but basically,
rawr.

197
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,800
And.

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,890
What we noticed about this,
like in early usability

199
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,280
studies as like this put a
smile on people's faces.

200
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,630
Like, hands down.

201
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,170
Right?

202
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,030
Universally.

203
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,640
And I think a lot of times
when we

204
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,530
are assessing products, we
never think about,

205
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,190
like, hey what is the
emotion on

206
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,490
the person's face when they
interact with this?

207
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
This is Vimeo's log in page
this is

208
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,070
actually a couple integr,
iterations ago.

209
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,540
It's one I find to be the
most beautiful, but.

210
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,200
It lets you know that when
you're starting out on

211
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,180
this journey with Vimeo,

212
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,640
that this is gonna be
something different.

213
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,170
They do this all over the
app.

214
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,810
If you search for the word
fart, as you scroll up and

215
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,190
down it makes fart noises as
you do this.

216
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,730
Right?

217
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,920
There's something different,

218
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,705
like this site interacts
with you.

219
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,290
>> Mm-hm.
>> It's a little bit

220
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,530
magical, it's a little bit
different.

221
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,510
And it's something that you
wanna talk about.

222
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,600
You don't have to always do
it with design.

223
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,700
This is a sign up form for

224
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,430
Cork which used to be a
social network for

225
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,700
people who loved to drink
wine.

226
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,190
On it, it says email
address,

227
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,240
it's also your sign-in and
has to be legit.

228
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,500
First name, what your mom
calls you, last name,

229
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,260
what your Army buddies call
you.

230
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,800
Password, something you'll
remember, but hard to guess,

231
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,340
password confirmation, think
it a, type it again.

232
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,560
Think of it as a test.

233
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,700
It's literally a poem as you
fill out the form.

234
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,540
Right?

235
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,690
And this is a kind of like
thing where you like,

236
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,110
oh, I like the people behind
this.

237
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,850
I, I, I'm gonna enjoy this
experience.

238
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,970
Now what does it say when
you fill out form like this?

239
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,470
Right.

240
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,960
On Yahoo, about what the
personality.

241
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,890
Of the site it's gonna be.

242
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,500
And what's disappointing to
me is like,

243
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,570
Yahoo forces every product
and

244
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,960
service under them to use
this exact same login form.

245
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,450
Flickr, I had thought,

246
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,280
had one of the best sort of
call to actions.

247
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,700
It was, get in there.

248
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,200
Right?

249
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,259
This is Heroku's.

250
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,650
Sign up page.

251
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,230
I think this is an older
version.

252
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,340
But, what's remarkable about
it is that, what you

253
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,180
start getting a feel for is
like, oh, scaling up.

254
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,000
My sort of server, and
