1057
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs
some things you have to learn
by doing.

1058
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,990
You can't learn to play the
guitar by reading a book.

1059
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,070
You've actually gotta try to
manage a bit, and

1060
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,960
you won't do it well.

1061
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,330
I had another sort of set of
tactics and

1062
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,455
classes on what you actually
do when you transition from

1063
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,040
an individual contributor to a
manager.

1064
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,610
It's hard.

1065
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,980
One of the first things people
don't get right is their time

1066
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,990
allocation.

1067
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:38,040
And so actually, I would
recommend doing what I

1068
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,250
call calendar audit and
tracking for a month what you

1069
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,000
spend your time on and how
much is managing and

1070
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,500
editing, and how much is
writing, et cetera, and

1071
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,510
then optimize it over time.

1072
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,430
You can get a mentor, find
somebody who's been a manager

1073
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,890
before that will work with
you, not your boss.

1074
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,910
Because your boss has a set
complicated objectives,

1075
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,810
including how much are we
shipping?

1076
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,520
A mentor can just focus on
you, and

1077
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
making you more successful.

1078
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,550
>> Can you give some more
examples of things you can

1079
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,040
do which show a consistent
voice of the company,

1080
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,450
especially with the company
growing?

1081
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,200
>> Yeah.

1082
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,920
so, I would look at every
piece of

1083
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,510
copy in every department.

1084
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,530
So like another area that
almost never is a done.

1085
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,720
So look at your recruiting
website.

1086
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,420
Almost never done to

1087
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,010
the same quality as your
conversion funnel.

1088
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,300
I look at customer support,

1089
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,270
another classic area that
isn't up to the same quality,

1090
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,710
and treat customer support
like a product.

1091
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,260
So that you actually have an
engineering team and

1092
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,770
a design team over time,

1093
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,460
that actually focuses on
making that world-class.

1094
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,540
Usually, where you have
different executives at

1095
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,960
a scaled company, most
executives were

1096
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,460
trained differently at
different companies, and

1097
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,490
they bring some of that with
them.

1098
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,770
So you've got to cross train
that.

1099
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,000
So, if you've hired a VP of
Engineering from Google.

1100
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,350
It's very different than a
design leader who

1101
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,100
came from Apple,

1102
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,120
they don't actually learn how
to do anything the same way.

1103
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,520
So you're going to have to
stitch that together somehow,

1104
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,090
either one or the other is
going to have to learn in

1105
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,330
the other style or you're
going to have to create your

1106
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,450
own style and really teach
that to your executives.

1107
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,970
So it shows up all the time
but

1108
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,270
all you do, all you need to do
is just pick up the company's

1109
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,910
products and look for things
that have a different voice.

1110
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,520
And you can see it.

1111
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,960
Visual voice, word choice,
all, all over the map.

1112
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,430
Sam?

1113
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,940
>> Could you talk a little bit
about the tactics of how

1114
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,675
you manage people?

1115
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:19,890
Like how you
>> So the canonical advice

1116
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,720
in this now sounds obvious but
actually was

1117
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,370
pretty radical in 1982 when
Andy wrote his first book is

1118
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,640
you should have a one on one
roughly every two weeks.

1119
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,030
Some people say every week,

1120
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,530
and I don't think you want to
go longer than two weeks,

1121
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,350
one week can be ideal actually
in many companies.

1122
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,770
The reason why in fact there's
ano, another adage which is,

1123
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:39,100
you should only have five to
seven direct reports.

1124
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,030
That actually derives from the
concept of a one on one

1125
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,140
every week.

1126
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,030
So that the direct reports, so
you can fit enough one on ones

1127
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,160
in your calendar and still get
other things done.

1128
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,810
So I think one on one's per
week are a good idea.

1129
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,460
The agenda should be crafted
by the employee who reports to

1130
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,960
the manager, not the manager.

1131
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,550
The one on one is mostly for

1132
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,500
the benefit of the employee,
so they should walk in with,

1133
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,660
here's the three or four
things I want to talk about.

1134
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,980
Ideally, they circulate that.

1135
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,230
It can be even bullet points
in advance by email.

1136
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,920
But, in advance you have time
to chew on it and

1137
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,840
you're not on the fly, winging
your responses.

1138
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,750
But that's probably the best
structure.

1139
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,690
Now if someone's really good
and really talented and

1140
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,530
has been doing something for

1141
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,750
a long time with a lot of
internal credibility,

1142
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,510
you might push out the one
every week, and

1143
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,350
relax that to one every two
weeks, possibly once a month.

1144
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,778
I don't know that I would go
beyond once a month ever.

1145
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:27,329
>> When is it acceptable to
compromise and

1146
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:31,480
hire someone who is ammunition
rather than a barrel?

1147
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,830
>> Yeah, so the question is
when,

1148
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,931
when do you compromise and

1149
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,280
hire more ammunition instead
of a barrel?

1150
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,260
Truthfully, you're going to
hire more ammunitions by

1151
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,070
definition than you are
barrels.

1152
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,910
So there's a ratio between the
two.

1153
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,610
The question is the ratio.

1154
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,830
So at some point the ratio is
going to get out of wack.

1155
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,340
So if you're the only barrel
in the company and

1156
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,760
you have 50 engineers, you
might as well only have ten

1157
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,590
engineers because you're not
going to get anymore done.

1158
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,820
So you're just wasting
resources.

1159
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,940
You're going to have
frustrated engineers,

1160
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,860
because everybody's going to
need your approval,

1161
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,180
your sign off, your editing.

1162
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,890
It's just going to stack and
frustrate people.

1163
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,520
So, it's really, now different
disciplines, engineering,

1164
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,860
like I actually think like
roughly one to ten to 20 is

1165
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,390
probably about the right
range.

1166
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,130
Like you don't need more
engineers until you

1167
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,640
have more barrels.

1168
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,940
Designers a little different,

1169
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,590
but it's always going to be
hiring more ammunitions.

1170
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,080
And a good leader,

1171
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,290
a good barrel will kind of
have a feel for that.

1172
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,680
So one way to, one way to
correct for this.

1173
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,000
Natural tendency is to
increase that your headcount

1174
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,470
on your team, like sort of an
empire building tendency.

1175
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,053
Like, oh so I manage 20
people, and

1176
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:33,940
Sam only manages ten, and you
manage three.

1177
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,078
So, I'm more important than
Sam and

1178
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,153
you're more important than
you.

1179
00:41:36,153 --> 00:41:37,782
One way to do that is you put
an X here of

1180
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:40,623
the number of people that the,
the output, sorry, specify how

1181
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,043
many things they've done
successfully then divide by

1182
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:45,619
the number of people on their
team, and tell them that this

1183
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,118
is going to be their grade in
their performance review.

1184
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,129
Shockingly this y doesn't
start increasing on that team.

1185
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:52,530
It's amazing how this works.

1186
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,211
And be really explicit about
it.

1187
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,015
>> As, venture capitalist,

1188
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,000
how often you intervene this
and, what's.

1189
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,480
>> So how often do I meet
with?

1190
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,145
>> Yeah.
How you.

1191
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,420
[CROSS-TALK].
>> So the question is,

1192
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,370
as a venture capitalist,

1193
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,300
how often do I interact with
my companies, meet with them.

1194
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,290
Generally when we invest and
we do,

1195
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,950
do some seed investments where
we invest less money but

1196
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,510
when we invest a fair amount
of money and

1197
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,410
lead a round like a series a a
series b round

1198
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:23,220
we join the board, and roughly
I meet with

1199
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,590
the founder CEO every two
weeks, that's the default.

1200
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,870
Now there can be obviously
there's inflection moments and

1201
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,390
things go right well or wrong.

1202
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,740
And, you know, that's on an
ad-hoc basis.

1203
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,510
These days, actually,

1204
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,080
surprisingly, I do a lot by
text message.

1205
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,270
I even have one CEO who
Snapchats me all the time.

1206
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,300
Which I'd actually rather not,
but, That, so.

1207
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,540
The world, the world has
changed a lot.

1208
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,980
But I try in-person meetings
every two weeks.

1209
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,430
>> Are you the no.

1210
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,850
I mean, really it's,

1211
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,220
like, being a venture
capitalist is more,

1212
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,320
to me, like being a
psychologist.

1213
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:56,940
So if you come to

1214
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,620
my office you'll see actually
we have two chairs,

1215
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,840
kind of arrayed like this with
a little table in the middle.

1216
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,530
And we sit down.

1217
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,730
And I'm basically, like, so
tell me your problems.

1218
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,560
You know?
[LAUGHTER] Then,

1219
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,750
it's like a question.

1220
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,670
It's like, so have you.

1221
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,030
And then the, and then my
response is usually,

1222
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:08,960
well have you thought about
this?

1223
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,860
Have you talked to this
person?

1224
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,890
Have you tried this?

1225
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,460
Et cetera.
And it's just asking a lot of

1226
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,730
questions and going back that
way.

1227
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,150
But that's 90% of what I do.

1228
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,000
So I see when you, when you've
got these barrels,

1229
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,580
you say your starter company
is up doing really good,

1230
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,940
you know, and you're working
on this project.

1231
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,840
I've heard that you should
always be recruiting.

1232
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,350
>> Yes.
>> How do you,

1233
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,060
how do you balance that.

1234
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,040
Well it depends on where your
prioritizations are.

1235
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,620
So you know, Sam talked a
little bit

1236
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,510
about this in his lecture,

1237
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,710
but every company will move
recruiting you know, first,

1238
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,630
second, or third somewhere in
that sort of spectrum.

1239
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,540
If it's your number one
priority then about 25% is

1240
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,560
probably a pretty good
allocation.

1241
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,310
Actually I like the calendar
audit for

1242
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,490
CEO's even more, so than for
new managers.

1243
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,120
So when I work with CEO's
sometimes who aren't.

1244
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,250
Thriving in that role for the
first time.

1245
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,670
Actually forced them to show
me their calendar.

1246
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,720
And before I do that, and now
I'm going to ruin this trick

1247
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,190
because if I tell it to you,
actually asked them to

1248
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,980
write their priorities, write
them down on a piece of paper.

1249
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,140
And, you know, discuss
whatever they are.

1250
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,700
Then we go pull up their
calendar, and

1251
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,410
see if it matches.

1252
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,660
And it never matches.

1253
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,340
They, never.

1254
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,790
They, recruiting is the one
that's most often.

1255
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,300
Awry so you know, let's say
half the CEO's you meet with

1256
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,300
will say recruiting's the
number one priority.

1257
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,540
It's almost never the biggest
block of

1258
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,660
time on anybody's calendar,
and so

1259
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,400
that's what you're trying to
do is match resources and

1260
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,210
inputs against priorities, and
a calendar audit unfortunately

1261
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,160
there's no software that does
this really well.

1262
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,850
It would be great.

1263
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,430
Like actually the,

1264
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,630
we literally pull up someone's
Google calendar and

1265
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,430
kind of manually add up the
hours.

1266
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,560
Which in, somewhat insane.

1267
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,000
But that's, that's the best
way is just,

1268
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,970
well what are your priorities.

1269
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,080
If your priorities are raising
money, you

1270
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,890
don't want to allocate 100% of
your time for recruiting.

1271
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,010
You want to allocate a fair
amount of time to raising

1272
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,508
money for that block of time
until you're successful at it.

1273
00:44:47,508 --> 00:44:50,650
>> One more question.

1274
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,900
>> One more question anybody,
okay, go ahead.

1275
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,570
>> On the surface some of the
advice students contradictory

1276
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,690
because you emphasized
focusing on a plus pass, and

1277
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,560
delegating less important
things, but then you said it's

1278
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,290
good to write like few page
script for your receptors.

1279
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,200
Focus on all the details.

1280
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
How do you harmonize those
goals?

1281
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,540
>> It's a good question.

1282
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,630
I think the way to harmonize.

1283
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,690
The question is really, how do
you harmonize things like,

1284
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,490
where details can really
matter but

1285
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,460
you only get one thing, you
know, to do and

1286
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,720
you've gotta allocate to the
top one, two, or three things.

1287
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,840
How do you, how do you put
those two things together?

1288
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,120
And actually there is some
tension in, even in a healthy

1289
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,510
organization, there's some
tension of like why are we

1290
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,210
actually focused on, you know,
writing the script.

1291
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,570
As opposed to something a user
may see.

1292
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,700
I think the underlying
philosophy of

1293
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,560
getting the details right is
pretty important to

1294
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,830
install in the very, very,
very beginning of

1295
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,910
a company because people will
start acting that way and

1296
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,930
making decisions that way
themselves.

1297
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:44,970
So, you won't have to actually
literally do that.

1298
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,970
And if you have to do that, it
actually shows you

1299
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,620
that the foundation isn't
actually that, that solid.

1300
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,730
So eh, when you first start
the company.

1301
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,760
It's about getting the details
right,

1302
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,230
that everybody is precise,

1303
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,490
everybody on every task is
always thinking that way.

1304
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,550
And then that scales, and

1305
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,880
then the people you bring in,
it's a little self-fulfilling,

1306
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,620
people who can think that way
will tend to get hired,

1307
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,350
people who can't won't get
hired.

1308
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,060
Each team, and

1309
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,240
each leader, will tend to
enforce that themselves,

1310
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,200
to see whose almost never
doing it.

1311
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,050
So, it's partially, like,

1312
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,050
how do you start, and at
cultures like that,

1313
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,230
I mean, the, key to culture is
it's a rule.

1314
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,810
It's a frame work for making
decisions.

1315
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,900
And if you have a cultured
people learn how to

1316
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,610
make decisions across that
culture and

1317
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:25,520
you're never day anything,
except just yeah watch.

1318
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,150
And you know and promote and
move people around.

1319
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,040
Cool, well I guess that's it,
thank you.
