00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno
Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,194
>> Move us all, thank you.

3
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:04,489
Cool, so you guys this is
awesome,

4
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:07,326
I've been watching the
lectures in this course,

5
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:09,840
isn't it absolutely amazing
the content?

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,087
And now you're stuck with me
today.

7
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,429
>> We'll, so how that goes.

8
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,376
Unlike Paul, when he was
talking in the Q and A,

9
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,323
and you guys asked him what
he would do if he was at

10
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,055
college today and

11
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,030
he said physics, I actually
indulged myself.

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,730
I went in, I went and did
physics,

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,019
did physics at Cambridge and
I think physics is

14
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,661
an amazing class to give you
transferable skills that

15
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,380
are really useful in other
areas.

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,960
But I guess that's not,

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
that's not why you're
listening to me today.

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,660
Like, physics isn't the
class, like, so I paid for

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,590
college doing online
marketing.

20
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,030
Direct sales marketing.

21
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,650
I started with SEO in the
1990s.

22
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,830
I created a paper airplane
site.

23
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,250
I had a monopoly.

24
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,180
In the small niche market of

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,890
paper airplanes globally
which you know,

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,250
when you want to start a
startup also see how big

27
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,660
the market could be in the
long term it wasn't great.

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,810
But what that taught me was
how to do SEO.

29
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,860
And back in those days it
was Altavista, and

30
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,720
the way to do SEO was to
have white text on

31
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,650
a white background five
pages below the fold.

32
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,700
And you would rank top of
Alta Vista if you just paper

33
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,010
airplanes 20 or 30 times in
that text.

34
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,220
And that was how you won at
SEO in the 1990s.

35
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,350
Like it was a really easy,
easy skill to learn.

36
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,840
When I went to college,
being a physicist,

37
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,580
I thought paper airplanes
would make me cool, and

38
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,920
I was actually the most
nerdy person in

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,230
the physics class, so I
created a cocktail site.

40
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,050
Which was how I learned to
program.

41
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,840
And that grew to be the
largest cocktail site in

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,210
the UK.

43
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,990
And that really got me into
SEO properly when

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,130
Google launched.

45
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,070
So with Google, you had to
worry about page rank, and

46
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,220
you had to worry about
getting links

47
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,810
back to your site.

48
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,010
Which basically, at that
stage,

49
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,260
meant one link from the
Yahoo directory.

50
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,750
Got you to the top listing
in Google if you had white

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,630
text, on a white background,
below the fold, as well.

52
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,520
When Google launched AdWords
that's when I

53
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,260
really started to learn how
to do all my marketing.

54
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,220
And that was buying paid
clicks from Google, and

55
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,480
reselling them to eBay for

56
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,970
a small margin of like 20%
using our affiliate program.

57
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,530
And that was what really
kicked me into overdrive

58
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,890
into doing what everyone
nowadays talks about is

59
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,370
growth, or growth hacking,
or growth marketing.

60
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,100
And in my mind it's just
internet marketing.

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,080
Using whatever channel you

62
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
can to get whatever output
you want.

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,820
And that's how I paid for
college and how I

64
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,430
ended up going from being a
physicist to a marketer and

65
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,110
transitioning to the dark
side of the force.

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,480
So what do you think matters
most for growth.

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,870
You've had loads of lectures
and

68
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,260
people have said it over and
over, so

69
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,970
what do you guys think
matters most for growth?

70
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,380
Someone give me an answer.

71
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,090
>> Great product.

72
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,750
>> Great product.

73
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,820
I agree, great product.

74
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,350
What does great product lead
to?

75
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,060
>> Customers.

76
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,640
>> Customers.

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,466
And what do you need those
customers to do?

78
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,058
>> Spread the word.

79
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:43,250
Someone said stay on your
site.

80
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,010
Someone said that.

81
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,530
That's it.
Retention.

82
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,450
Retention is the single most
important thing for growth.

83
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,390
Now we have an awesome
growth team at Facebook, and

84
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm super proud to work on
it.

85
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,400
But the truth of

86
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,230
the matter is we have a
fantastic product.

87
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,000
But getting to work on
growth at Facebook is

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,570
a massive privilege, because
we're promoting something

89
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,430
that everyone in the world
really wants to use.

90
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,690
Which is absolutely
incredible.

91
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,110
If we can get people on, and

92
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,740
get them ramped up, they
stick on Facebook.

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,810
So many times I go advise
multiple startups,

94
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,460
my favorite was working with
Airbnb, but

95
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,980
I've worked with Coursera,
I've worked with

96
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,550
other ones that haven't done
as well as those guys.

97
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,990
But the one thing that is
true over, and over, and

98
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,850
over again is if you look at
this curve.

99
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,050
The sentiment, the active,

100
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,890
versus number of days from
acquisition.

101
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,140
If you end up with a
retention curve that

102
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,080
ascentotes to a line
parallel to the x axis.

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
You have a viable business,
and

104
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,080
you have product market fit
for some subset of market.

105
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,790
But most of the companies
that you see fly up,

106
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,780
we talk about growth hacking
and virality and

107
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,860
all of this other stuff.

108
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm gonna try so hard not to
swear, but it'll happen.

109
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,480
Their attention curve slopes
down towards the X-axis, and

110
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,620
in the end intercepts the
X-axis.

111
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,040
Now when I show this chart
to

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
most people they say that's
all well and good.

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,290
You had a million people a
day in terms of

114
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,500
growth when you started the
growth team at Facebook, or

115
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,320
you were at 50 million
users.

116
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,950
You had a lot of people
joining the site so

117
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,280
you had a ton of data to do
this.

118
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
We used this same
methodology for

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
our B to B growth.

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Getting people to sign up as
self-service advertisers,

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,300
we used this analysis to
understand how much

122
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,070
growth we were gonna have in
that market as well.

123
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,140
And in that place,

124
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,180
when I joined Facebook, the
product was three days old.

125
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,020
And within 90 days of the
product launching,

126
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,990
we were able to use this
technique to be able to

127
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,600
figure out what the one year
value of an advertiser was,

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
and we predicted it for the
first year to 97% of

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,460
what the number turned out
to be.

130
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,880
So I think it's very
important to look at

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,730
your attention curve, and
this is how we did it.

132
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,520
If you see here.

133
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,420
This red line is number of
users,

134
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,560
who have been on your
product for

135
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
a certain number of days.

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,090
So, a bunch of people, that
should say zero,

137
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,180
a bunch of people will have
been on your product,

138
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,900
all of your users will have
been on it at least one day.

139
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
But, if your product's been
around a year, or whatever,

140
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,940
you will have zero users
who've been on it 366 days.

141
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,530
Make sense?

142
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,480
The curves sensible?

143
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,870
Cool.

144
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,400
So what you then do is look
for all of your users,

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,450
who have been on your
product one day.

146
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,440
What percentage of them are
monthly active.

147
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,610
100% for the first 30 days
obviously,

148
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,360
because monthly active they
all signed up on one day.

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,150
But then you look at 31.

150
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,920
Every single user, on their
31st day after registration,

151
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,910
what percentage of them were
monthly active, 32nd day,

152
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,910
33rd day, 34th day?

153
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,030
And that allows you,

154
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,120
with only something like
10,000 customers or

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,050
whatever, to get a real idea
of what this curve is

156
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,630
gonna look like for your
product.

157
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,738
And you're gonna be able to
tell does it asymptote.

158
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,670
And it'll get noisy out
towards the right-hand side.

159
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,270
Like I'm not using real
data.

160
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,980
It'll get noisy out towards
the right hand side, but

161
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,820
you'll be able to get a
handle on,

162
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,280
does this curve flatten out
or does it not.

163
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,100
If it doesn't flatten out,
don't go and

164
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
do growth tactics, don't go
and

165
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,950
do virality, don't hire a
growth hacker.

166
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,840
Focus on getting product
market fit.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,600
Because in the end,

168
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,780
as Sam said in the beginning
of this course,

169
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,610
idea, product, team,
execution.

170
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,980
If you don't have a great
product,

171
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,070
there's no point executing
well on growing it.

172
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,760
Because it won't grow.

173
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
Number one problem I've seen
inside Facebook for

174
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,550
new products, number one
problem I've seen for

175
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,590
startups I ever devised has
been, they don't actually

176
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,360
have product market fit when
they think they do.

177
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,000
So the next obvious question
that people ask over and

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,450
over and over again is okay,
so

179
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,010
what does good retention
look like?

180
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,200
Sure I can have five percent
retention but

181
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm guessing that Facebook
had better than that, so

182
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,090
that's not gonna be a
successful business.

183
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,240
And I get really pissed off
when

184
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,220
people ask me that question.

185
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,610
Because I think you can
figure it out.

186
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,620
And I love this story, and
this is like my one

187
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,860
gratuitous story that I love
that I'm throwing in here,

188
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,950
so the rest of it may not be
as gratuitous.

189
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,870
But this is a picture that
was published in

190
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,120
Life magazine in 1950 of

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,210
one of the Trinity nuclear
bomb tests.

192
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,210
And there's a guy,

193
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,740
Geoffrey Taylor, who's heard
of Geoffrey Taylor.

194
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,850
Awesome.

195
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,370
Yes.

196
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,450
Someone's heard of him.

197
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,200
Geoffrey Taylor was a
British physicist,

198
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,490
who ended up actually
winning the Nobel Prize.

199
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,490
And he was able to figure
out from looking at

200
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,440
this picture, what the power
of the atomic bomb was,

201
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,610
the U.S. atomic bomb.

202
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,800
And Russian's were
publishing similar pictures,

203
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
just using dimensional
reasoning.

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,820
And dimensional reasoning is
I think,

205
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,690
one of the best skills that
I learned during my

206
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,260
time studying physics back
in the U.K..

207
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,780
And what dimensional
reasoning is, is you look at

208
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,690
the dimensions that are
involved in a problem.

209
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,210
So, you wanna figure out
energy?

210
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,310
Newtons, meters, newtons are
kilograms, meters are second

211
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,060
to the minus 2, so you've
got kilograms,

212
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,570
meters squared, seconds to
the minus 2,

213
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,850
and then you try and figure
out how you can get each of

214
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,430
those numbers from what data
you have.

215
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,280
So, the mass.

216
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,620
Is the volume of this
sphere.

217
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,950
So, that's a meter cubed you
throw in there.

218
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,590
So you've got meters the 5
over seconds the minus 2,

219
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,300
and he was able to use that
to just figure out

220
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,200
what the power of this
atomic bomb was,

221
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,030
what the ratios of the power
between the Russian and

222
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,230
US atomic bomb, and
essentially reveal one of

223
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,400
the top secrets that existed
in the world at that time.

224
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,160
That's a hard problem.

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,790
Figuring out what

226
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,130
Facebook's retention rate is
not a hard problem.

227
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,140
How many people are there on
the internet?

228
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,823
Give or take someone throw
something out.

229
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,380
>> 2.4 billion, 2.3 billion.

230
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,630
Something like that right?

231
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,320
Okay, Facebook's banned in
China.

232
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,310
So.

233
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,810
What now?

234
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,230
>> About a billion.

235
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,250
>> About 2 billion?

236
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,440
2 billion.
So

237
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
2 billion people on the
internet.

238
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,030
Facebook in their last
earnings call

239
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,620
said something around 1.3
billion in

240
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,830
terms of the number of
active users.

241
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,550
You can divide those numbers
by each other.

242
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,330
And yeah, that won't give
you the right answer.

243
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,780
Course it's not gonna give
you the right answer.

244
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,450
But it's gonna give you

245
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,250
close enough to a ballpark
figure.

246
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,540
Of what the retention rate
looks like for Facebook.

247
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,510
If we signed everyone on the
internet up, and

248
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,650
then you will know it is
higher than that.

249
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,610
Similarly if you look at
Whats App, they've announced

250
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,550
six hundred million active
users.

251
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,700
How many people have smart
phones?

252
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,800
You can figure out that
number.

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,490
That number is out knocking
around.

254
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,180
It can give an idea of how
many users there are.

255
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,230
Amazon has had a pop at

256
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,720
signing up almost everyone
in the United States.

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,930
You know how many people are
online in the US, and

258
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,940
you've got a good idea of
how many

259
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,030
customers Amazon are from
the numbers they throw out.
