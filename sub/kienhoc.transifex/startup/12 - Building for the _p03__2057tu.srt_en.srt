583
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,120
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFVDjrvQJdw
had the where with all, the
talent,

584
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,740
the infrastructure and the
budget to deploy your

585
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,470
technology into the
enterprise.

586
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,350
Today, literally a two
person company can sign up

587
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,870
for box, as well as we work
with General Electric which

588
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,830
has over 300,000 employees.

589
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,860
So, the fact that you can
now serve a small

590
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,700
business anywhere in the
world.

591
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,130
As well as some of the
largest companies on

592
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,480
the planet, mean that

593
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,070
there's much larger markets
that you can go after.

594
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,970
Which makes it, obviously,
even a better economic

595
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,380
proposition to go after the
enterprise.

596
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,450
The platforms themselves are
becoming more global.

597
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,730
So our customers were
international literally

598
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,310
within the first couple of
weeks,

599
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,540
of starting the company.

600
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,950
It would have been, usually
if you had done enterprise

601
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,320
software the traditional way
that would have taken years,

602
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,130
to actually be able to go
international.

603
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,490
And then finally and

604
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,280
probably the most profound
shift of all.

605
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,820
Is that because of mobile
devices, you know,

606
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,170
iPhone's, iPad's, tablets
Android devices, the IT

607
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,340
model of the enterprise has
become a lot more user led.

608
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,580
And, that's fundamentally
important because,

609
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,260
in an IT led world,
incumbents generally win.

610
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,480
Because, they have the
existing

611
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,680
relationship with the IT
organization, with the CIO,

612
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,520
with the spending power
within that company.

613
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,350
In a user led model, users
are bringing in,

614
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,700
their own technology.

615
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,690
They're bringing it in on
the sales team,

616
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,060
they're bringing it in, in
the marketing team,

617
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,000
they're bringing it in in
finance.

618
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,330
And you can build software
then around the user.

619
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,540
Which means that they can
bring the technology in.

620
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,430
Then you can sell to the
enterprise when they

621
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,460
wanna have better control,

622
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,360
better security, better
scalability.

623
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,893
So you still have the same
business model,

624
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,650
as a traditional enterprise
software company.

625
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,785
But the way to get into the
company is now,

626
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:44,950
through the end user.

627
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,160
Okay, so those are
qualitative factor changes.

628
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,192
Just a couple quantitative
factor changes.

629
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:52,882
There's over,

630
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,192
nearly 2 billion smart
phones on the planet.

631
00:24:55,192 --> 00:25:00,010
That changes, every single
IT model, on the planet,

632
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,720
because it used to be, ten
years ago, if you

633
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,860
were managing technology for
an enterprise.

634
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,590
You just had to manage the
computers and

635
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,560
the network that were inside
of your building.

636
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,830
But now with billions of
mobile phones,

637
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,920
you fundamentally have to be
able to

638
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,240
manage the network and the
computing.

639
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,950
That is gonna be anywhere at
anytime on a network.

640
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,925
And that creates massive
opportunity for

641
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:19,998
software companies,

642
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,880
because no incumbent has
built the technology stack.

643
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,130
Sorry for my voice breaking
again,

644
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,450
so no incumbent has built a
technology stack.

645
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,170
That powers this next
generation of work, and

646
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,830
how enterprises are using
their data.

647
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,789
So that creates a massive
start up opportunity.

648
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,490
There's nearly 3 billion
people online.

649
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,230
What that means is that
every single enterprise is

650
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,310
equally changing how they're
gonna get their own products

651
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,700
to their customers.

652
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,090
Which means, that every
industry changes.

653
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,450
And so, there are really
only two times,

654
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,420
there are only two moments
of opportunity.

655
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,510
Where a technology
revolution will happen in

656
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,160
the enterprise.

657
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,410
The first is if the raw
materials change.

658
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,430
So, cost of computing goes
down and then it's better to

659
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,710
centralize, and then let
people use it on demand.

660
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,520
The second major change is
that the very customers that

661
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,580
these enterprises have to go
after, need new

662
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,180
experiences of working with
those enterprises' products.

663
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,330
Let me give you an example.

664
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,430
If, you know, when you go
out off campus, you

665
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,860
probably use something like
Uber or Lyft, as an example.

666
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,180
The if you were in the
transportation business.

667
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,143
If you're in the shipping
business,

668
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:30,200
if you're in the logistic
business,

669
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,420
Uber represents a massive
change to your industry.

670
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,720
So you can't just let Uber
exist and

671
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,600
do its own thing without
understanding.

672
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,920
What are the implications of
Uber?

673
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,330
What are the implications of
InstaCart?

674
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,380
What are the implications of
Lyft to my business model?

675
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,800
And so, in a world where,

676
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,470
enterprises are dealing with
that kind of change.

677
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,260
They're gonna need new
technology,

678
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,980
to help them evolve their
business models, and

679
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,900
how they adapt to this
disruption.

680
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,370
And so in every industry,
and

681
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,820
this is why it's an amazing
time to even build vertical

682
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,030
software companies for
industries.

683
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,460
Right now, every single
industry is going through

684
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,270
a major business model and

685
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,810
technology oriented
disruption.

686
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,080
Which means that they're
going to need

687
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,110
technology from startups to
help them work through this.

688
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,200
I'll give you a couple of
examples.

689
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,770
So, in the retail industry.

690
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,882
There's this notion of sort
of omni-channel or

691
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:23,450
multi-channel commerce.

692
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,330
You're gonna shop online,

693
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,540
you're gonna shop on your
phone,

694
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,390
you're gonna shop in a
store, and

695
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,500
you want things to be
delivered to you as well.

696
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,410
So most of the incumbent
technology in the retail

697
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,690
industry, doesn't power
multi-channel commerce.

698
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,540
No, nobody is prepared for

699
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,890
what does it mean when
consumers wanna go actually

700
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,450
buy goods at anytime from
anywhere.

701
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,410
With better information and
better intelligence.

702
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,100
So every retailer in the
world, is gonna need a new

703
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,760
technology stack to power
their retail experiences.

704
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,100
In the health care space,
every single health care

705
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,160
institution is trying to
find ways of building a more

706
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,860
personalized experiences,
more predictive experiences.

707
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,580
They wanna have medicine be
adapted to the individual.

708
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,630
As the business model of

709
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:11,100
health care changes from
being about charging for

710
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,342
the surgery, charging for
the checkup.

711
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:16,200
And instead where the
customer pays for

712
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,100
wellness and staying
healthy.

713
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,600
Then all the sudden every
healthcare institution,

714
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,940
needs better technology to
deliver health care

715
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,840
experiences.

716
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,668
They're gonna wanna deliver
telemedicine.

717
00:28:25,668 --> 00:28:27,800
They're gonna wanna deliver
healthcare in more

718
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,310
regional locations as
opposed to

719
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,150
just in the monolithic
hospital environment.

720
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,050
There's going to be new use
cases around.

721
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,550
How do our electronic health
records get connected to

722
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,610
one another so doctors can
make far better decisions.

723
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,820
All of these things are
gonna require new enterprise

724
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,600
software to power these
businesses and

725
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,960
these industries.

726
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,370
In the media space as an
example.

727
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,070
You know, you have a world
where an industry is

728
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,820
going from really linear
programming.

729
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,880
So whether that's
television, or

730
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
that's music, or whether
that's movies, there's sorta

731
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,140
very linear supply chain
oriented business model.

732
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,280
Where a film gets made,

733
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,320
it goes to the movie theater
for three months and

734
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,800
then afterwards it goes to
iTunes and

735
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,070
these other platforms.

736
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,360
To a world where people want
experiences on demand.

737
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,910
So that's gonna change,

738
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,850
how distribution works on
the scale of 3 billion

739
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,210
people that are on the
internet.

740
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,850
And again, no media company
has a platform.

741
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,750
That is gonna be able to
actually power,

742
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,480
how content and data and

743
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,430
information moves through
the system at scale.

744
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,010
We were just,

745
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,410
I was just in LA yesterday
meeting with a media

746
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,760
company that has basically
done predictive analytics.

747
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,074
To find their potential
movie goers in

748
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:38,132
the population of 3 billion
internet users.

749
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:41,122
They wanna be hyper targeted
on how they get to the very,

750
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:44,280
the sorta specific 30
million people that are fans

751
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,660
of different kinds of film
types.

752
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,230
And so all of a sudden, you
have a movie company,

753
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,872
that actually needs big
data.

754
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,686
And they need business
intelligence and

755
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:54,241
they need marketing
automation.

756
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,176
To go power how they're
gonna go market and

757
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:57,372
distribute their movie.

758
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:58,191
So again.

759
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:00,270
Totally unpredictable
mash-up of two

760
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,042
industries coming together,
where all new kinds of

761
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:05,050
software is gonna be
necessary.

762
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,080
So, every industry is going
through some form of

763
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,060
this change.

764
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,530
You can pick any industry
you want, and take and

765
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,230
sort of zoom into it and
say, what are the underlying

766
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,900
technology factors that are
gonna change the business

767
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,540
model of this industry in
the next couple of years?

768
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,960
And then there's gonna need
to be software that goes and

769
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,170
powers those experiences.

770
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,880
Cool, are we all on the same
page, great.

771
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,770
I just need a drink water,
so

772
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,058
if you could say something
that would be great.

773
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,640
>> Can we also edit out my
water drinking, so

774
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,560
it doesn't make it look like
I

775
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,030
have some weird water
problem?

776
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,478
Okay, cool.

777
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,740
I mean, think about the
future of water.

778
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,620
Who's gonna power that,
right?

779
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,955
>> Gonna need, that's gonna
need software, I'm sure, so.

780
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:54,325
>> So basically, every
company in the world.

781
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:57,345
We think of, you know, the
good fortune of being in

782
00:30:57,345 --> 00:31:00,084
Palo Alto, being at Stanford
is, is we're so

783
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:02,080
hyper-focused on technology.

784
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,480
And we think of the
technology industry as

785
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,470
an industry, but in reality
what is

786
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,410
happening is every company,
every industry is gonna have

787
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,840
a technology component of
what they do.

788
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,643
You won't be able to survive
in the future,

789
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:16,886
enterprises will not be able
to survive in the future,

790
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:18,514
if they don't get good at
technology.

791
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,300
If they don't have a
competency in

792
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,080
leveraging data and using
these new tools.

793
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,780
But they're gonna do that
through working with

794
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,010
what we consider the
technology industry,

795
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,250
as opposed to everybody
building up these pockets of

796
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,290
expertise themselves.

797
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,540
So there's gonna be a lot of
partnership over the next

798
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,900
five to ten years, where
companies are gonna need to

799
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,910
use technology to work
smarter, to work faster.

800
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,630
They're gonna need to do
this more securely, and

801
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,630
this is gonna change, not
only how individuals work in

802
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,310
these environments, but
ultimately change

803
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,118
the business models of these
companies.

804
00:31:49,118 --> 00:31:53,090
So that was chapter two of
this.

805
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,410
That's all the things that
have been changed.

806
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,534
Now some practical advice,

807
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:59,370
where to kind of help you
get started.

808
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,010
And to be fair, most of this
advice is

809
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,890
looking through the sort of
lens of retrospect, which

810
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,130
means that, that this is not
always how things happen.

811
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,940
But I can look back in time
and say,

812
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,090
these are things that led
certain things to be true.

813
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,990
So it's hard to be super
deterministic about building

814
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,110
a company, and you might not
have all of these things

815
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,943
totally figured out.

816
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,330
But these will give you a
sense of some of

817
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,270
the patterns to recognize
and

818
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,670
opportunities to exploit as
you're building, or

819
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,805
thinking about building, an
enterprise software company.

820
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:35,890
So the first is, spot
technology disruptions.

821
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,540
And this is gonna be

822
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,950
true whether you're building
consumer or enterprise.

823
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,260
The rest are more enterprise
oriented, but

824
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,010
this is just fundamental to
entrepreneurship,

825
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,610
if you're gonna build a tech
company.

826
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,612
So you have to look for new
enabling technologies or

827
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:52,337
major trends, like
fundamental trends, that

828
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,432
create a wide gap between
how things have been done,

829
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,990
and how they can be done.

830
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,670
And so, looking back in time
at our business, the gap was

831
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,260
basically, storage is
getting cheaper, internet

832
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,520
was getting faster, browsers
were getting better.

833
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,840
Yet we're still sharing
files through this

834
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,990
very complicated, very
esoteric, very slow and

835
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,200
cumbersome means.

836
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,000
So any time where the delta
between what is possible and

837
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
how things work today is at
its widest,

838
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,550
that is an opportunity to go
build new technology to go

839
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,940
solve a problem.

840
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,170
And so as you're looking at
the enterprise,

841
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:32,230
the question is, what about
the cost of computing

842
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,680
dropping so rapidly changes
what enterprises can

843
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,300
do with their data?

844
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,030
What does it change about
what you

845
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,390
can do from a business model
standpoint?

846
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,150
What was impossible, because
of either

847
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,660
economic feasibility or
technical feasibility 10 or

848
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,890
15 years ago, that now all
of a sudden is possible.

849
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,440
And a fun thing you can do
sometime is,

850
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,140
if you go look at articles
from like the 1990's or

851
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,810
even the 1980's, business
articles about technology.

852
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,580
All we're really doing is
repeating a lot of

853
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,300
the technologies that were
tried 10, 20, 30 years ago.

854
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,200
It's just, it was too
expensive,

855
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,740
it was too unusable, and we
didn't have

856
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,460
the enabling technologies to
make it possible.

857
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,280
So you can kind of see this
pattern emerge constantly

858
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,420
where something that was
impossible five or 10 years

859
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,030
ago, all of a sudden becomes
very practical.

860
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,720
So I'll give you an example.

861
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,790
There's a company called
PlanGrid.

862
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,140
Does anybody know what
PlanGrid does?

863
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,660
Okay.
Cool.

864
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,530
Are you in the construction
industry?

865
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,660
You are?

866
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,250
>> Yes, I am.

867
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,040
>> Oh, my god.
What does that even mean?

868
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,030
>> In terms of PlanGrid or
like in construction?

869
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,530
>> Construction.

870
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,140
>> I work at a job site.

871
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,470
We build buildings.

872
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,107
>> Holy crap, that's great.

873
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,641
>> Okay, so.
