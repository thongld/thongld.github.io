00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,558
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFX95HahaUs
I want to start with a
question for, for Mark and

2
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:11,364
Ron which is by far the
number 1 question What made

3
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:15,150
you guys decide to invest in
a founder or a company.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,140
Either of you.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,510
>> Start.
>> No, no, no, no.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,320
>> You first.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,870
>> Well we have a slide on
that.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,620
We have, we have an app for
that.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,608
>> Mark can start while we
try to get your slide up.

10
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:28,253
>> Okay.

11
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:34,989
>> We're running out of AV
guys, so.

12
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,670
>> So say the question
again.

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,170
>> What makes you decide to
invest in

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,090
a founder or a company?

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,720
>> So what makes us invest
in a company is

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,620
based on a whole bunch of
characteristics.

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,910
I've been doing this since
1994,

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,550
right before Mark got out of
the University of Illinois.

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,080
So, SV Angel and

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,610
it's entities have invested
in over 700 companies.

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,890
So, to invest in 700
companies that means we've

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,630
physically talked to
thousands of entrepreneurs.

23
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,480
And there's a whole bunch of
things that

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,130
just go through my head when
I meet an entrepreneur.

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,850
And I'm just going to talk
about what some of

26
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,469
those are.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,760
And literally while you're
talking to me in

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,610
the first minute I'm saying,
is this person a leader?

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,550
You know, is this person
rifled, focused and

30
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,290
obsessed by the product.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,220
I'm hoping cuz usually the
first question I ask is what

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,260
inspired you to invent this
product.

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm hoping that it's based
on a personal problem that,

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,470
that founder had and

35
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,500
this product is the solution
to that personal problem.

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,100
Then I'm looking for
communication skills.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,850
Because if you're gonna be a
leader and hire a team,.

38
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,860
Assuming your product is
successful you've gotta be

39
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,730
a really good communicator
and you,

40
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,440
you have to be a born
leader.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,110
Now some of that you might
have to learn those

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,710
traits of leadership but you
better take charge and

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,910
be able to be a leader.

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,849
I'll switch back to slide
but let's let Mark.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,110
>> Yeah, I, I agree with all
that,

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,600
I guess, and there's a lot
of detail to

47
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,570
this question that we could
talk about.

48
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,210
And we maybe even a little
bit different than Ron,

49
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,330
and, well we are different
than Ron,

50
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,940
that we actually invested
across stages.

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,180
So we invested the seed
stage, the interest stage,

52
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,090
the growth stage.

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,360
And then we invest in a
variety of

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,740
different business models,
consumer enterprise, and

55
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,690
a bunch of variations.

56
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,687
So, there are kind of fine
grained answers, you know,

57
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:38,536
that we could get into,

58
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,779
if there are specific
questions.

59
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,090
Two general concepts that I
would share.

60
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,260
So one is the venture
capital business is

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,090
a 100% a game of outliers.

62
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,330
It's extreme exceptions.

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,502
Right?
So the conventional

64
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,369
statistics are,

65
00:02:51,369 --> 00:02:55,080
you know, on the order,of
4,000 venture fundable.

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,910
Companies a year that wanna
raise venture capital about,

67
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,740
you know, about 200 of those
will get funded by

68
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,910
what's considered a top tier
VC.

69
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,890
About 15 of those will
someday get to $100 million

70
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,990
in revenue and those 15 from
that year will generate

71
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,700
something on the order of
97% of all the returns.

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,210
For the entire category of

73
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,100
venture capital in that
year.

74
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,710
And so venture capital is
such an extreme feat for

75
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,480
family business.

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,830
You're either in one of the
fifteen or your not.

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,120
Or you're in one of the two
hundred or your not.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
And so the big thing that
your looking for

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,010
no matter you know which
sort of

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,330
particular kind of criteria
we talk about.

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,509
They all have the
characteristic of

82
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,930
you're looking for the
extreme outlier.

83
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,450
The other thing I'd
highlight that we

84
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,170
think about a lot internally
is we have this

85
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,170
concept invest in strength
versus lack of weakness.

86
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,410
And at first that sounds
obvious but

87
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,590
it's actually fairly subtle
which is sort of the default

88
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,870
way to do venture capital is
to kinda check boxes, right?

89
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,670
So you know, really good
founder, really good idea,

90
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,880
you know really good, you
know, products, really good

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,060
initial customers, check
check check check.

92
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,580
Okay, if this is reasonable,
I'll put money in it.

93
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,890
What you find with those,
those sorta checkbox deals.

94
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,900
So they get, they get done
all the time.

95
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,510
What you find is they don't
have something that

96
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,410
really makes them really
remarkable and special.

97
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,970
Right?
They don't have

98
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,140
an extreme strength that
makes them an outlier.

99
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,860
On the other side of that
the companies that have

100
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,365
the really extreme strengths
often have serious flaws.

101
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:17,240
And so one of the cautionary
lessons of venture capital

102
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,040
is, if you don't invest on
the basis of serious flaws.

103
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,830
You don't invest in most of
the big winners, and

104
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,820
we can go through example
after

105
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,570
example after example of
that.

106
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,780
But that would have ruled
out almost all

107
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,240
the big winners over time.

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,650
And so, at least what we
aspire to do is to invest in

109
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,340
the one, the startups that
have a really, really

110
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,630
extreme strength, along an
important dimension.

111
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,730
And they'd be willing to

112
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,750
tolerate some other,you
know, set of weaknesses.

113
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,300
>> Ron, we got your slide
up.

114
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,970
>> Okay, I don't want to
over dwell on the slide.

115
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,140
But when you first meet an
investor,

116
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,060
you've got to be able to say
in one

117
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,200
compelling sentence that you
should practice like crazy.

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
What your product does,

119
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,780
so that the investor that
your talking to,

120
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,316
immediately can picture the
product in their own mind.

121
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,082
Probably 25% of the
entrepreneurs I

122
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,349
talk to today still after
the first sentence,

123
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,950
I don't know what they do.

124
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,640
And as I get older and less
patient, I say.

125
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,380
Back up, I don't even know
what you do yet.

126
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,760
But, so try and get that
perfect.

127
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,370
And then I wanna skip to the
second column.

128
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,000
You have to be decisive.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,860
The only way to make
progress is make decisions.

130
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,760
Procrastination is the devil
in startups.

131
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,950
So no matter what you do,

132
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,740
you gotta keep that ship
moving.

133
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,510
If it's decisions to hire,
decisions to fire.

134
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,490
You've gotta make those
quickly.

135
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,170
All about building a great
team.

136
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,090
Once you have a great
product, then it's all about

137
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,680
execution and building a
great team.

138
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,660
>> Parker, could you talk
about your seed ground and

139
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,320
how that went, and

140
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,551
what you wish you had done
differently as a foundry,

141
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,652
raising money?

142
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:07,180
>> Sure, so actually I think

143
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,170
that my seed ground most of
the stuff with my current

144
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,980
company felt like, from a
fundraising perspective felt

145
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,300
like it came together
relatively quickly.

146
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,677
But actually one of the
experiences I had,

147
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,383
I started a company before
this, that I was at for

148
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:22,363
about six years and my
cofounder and

149
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:25,465
I pitched almost every VC
firm in Silicon Valley,

150
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:28,237
we literally went to like 60
different firms and

151
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:29,840
they all told us no.

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,300
And we were constantly
trying to figure out.

153
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,740
You know, how do we, how
should we adjust our pitch?

154
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,910
And how should we do our
slides differently.

155
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,830
And how do we Tweet the
story, and

156
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,370
that sort of thing.

157
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,040
And at one point there was
this sort of

158
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,840
key insight that someone
gave me when I was pitching.

159
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,455
Actually someone at Coastal
Ventures.

160
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:47,830
And this VC said guys.

161
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,740
You know, he was looking for

162
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,770
some very particular kind of
analysis that we

163
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,890
didn't have on hand.

164
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,400
And he was like, guys, you
don't get it.

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,510
He was like, you know,

166
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,310
if you guys were the Twitter
guys,

167
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,362
you guys could come in and
you could just be,

168
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:01,950
like, and, like, put
whatever up here.

169
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,130
And, like, we would invest
in you.

170
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,830
But, like you guys aren't
the Twitter guys so

171
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,180
you need to make this really
easy and

172
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,820
have like all this stuff
ready for us and

173
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,000
all this kind of stuff.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,120
And I took like the exactly
opposite lesson of what,

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,440
he, I think, wanted me to
take away from that, with.

176
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Which was like, jeez, like I
should really just

177
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,210
figure out a way to be the
Twitter guys.

178
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,215
>> I'm, like, that's, that's
the way to do this.

179
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,900
And so, actually like one of

180
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,040
the reasons I started my
current company.

181
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,010
Or one of the things I found
very attractive about

182
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,410
Zenefits, is as I was
thinking about it.

183
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,660
It seemed like a business.

184
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,090
I was so frustrated from
this experience of

185
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,520
having tried, you know, for

186
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,090
like two years to raise
money from VC's.

187
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,130
And then sort of decided
like to hell with it.

188
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,830
You can't count on there
being

189
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,930
capital available to you.

190
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,940
And so this,

191
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,198
the business that I started
seemed like one that like,

192
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:51,050
like actually just maybe I
could do it without raising

193
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,750
money at all.

194
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,590
Like there might be a path
to kind of, you know,

195
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,510
there was enough cash flow,

196
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,770
it seemed compelling enough
that I could like, do that.

197
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,030
And it turns out that those
are exactly the kinds of

198
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,850
businesses that investors
love to invest in.

199
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,340
And it made it incredibly
easy.

200
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,020
So I actually think like, I
mean, Sam's very kind and

201
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,070
said I was an expert
fundraiser.

202
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,680
The reality is I don't
actually even think I'm

203
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,820
very good at fundraising.

204
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,450
It's probably something, I'm
like less good at then,

205
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,940
you know, sort of other
parts of my jobs.

206
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,080
But I think if you can build
a business that's, you know,

207
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,000
where everything's like
moving in

208
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
the right direction.

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,450
If you can be like the
Twitter guys,

210
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,910
like nothing else matters
and if you can't like,

211
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,030
you know, be the Twitter
guys it's very hard for

212
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,680
anything else to make a
difference.

213
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,420
For things to kind of come
together for you.

214
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,540
>> Why did that VC say be
like the Twitter guys when

215
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,550
the fail wail dominated the
site for two years.

216
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,330
>> Cause it worked.

217
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,274
>> Yeah.
>> The other point I want to

218
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:55,744
make is, bootstrap as long
as you possibly can.

219
00:08:55,744 --> 00:09:01,322
I met with one of the best
founders in tech.

220
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:03,366
Who's starting a new company
and

221
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:07,180
I said to her when when are
you going to raise money?

222
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,740
I might not.

223
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,490
And I go that is awesome.

224
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,750
You know never forget the
bootstrap.

225
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,140
>> So I was actually going
to close on this but

226
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,790
i'm just going to accelerate
it cause Parker I think just

227
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,463
gave you the most important
thing you'll ever hear.

228
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,223
Which is also what I was
going to say.

229
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,541
Which is, so, the number one
piece of advice that

230
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,670
I've ever read and

231
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,860
that I tell people on these
kinds of topics is always.

232
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,300
It's from the comedian Steve
Martin, who I think is

233
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,160
an absolute genius, wrote a
great book on his startup

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,190
career which obviously was
very successful.

235
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,340
The book is called, Born
Standing Up, and he,

236
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,750
literally, it's a short
little book and

237
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,630
it describes how he became
Steve Martin.

238
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,930
And the part of the book is,
he says, you know,

239
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,630
what is the key to success,

240
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,940
he says the key to success
is be so

241
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,810
good they can't ignore you.

242
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,390
Right, and so in a sense,
like all this,

243
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,080
we're gonna have this entire
conversation though, which

244
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,520
I'm sure we'll keep having
about how to raise money,

245
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,960
but in a sense it's all kind
of beside the point.

246
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,360
Because if you do what
Parker's done and

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,270
you build a business that is
going to be a gigantic

248
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,150
success then investors are
throwing money at you.

249
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,940
And if you come in, you
know, with a theory and

250
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,570
a plan and no data and
you're just one of,

251
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,100
you know, the next thousand.

252
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,686
It's gonna be far, far
harder to raise money.

253
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,750
The other, so that's the
positive way to put it,

254
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,990
is kind of be so good they
can't ignore you.

255
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,580
In other words, you're
almost always better off

256
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,620
making your business better
than you

257
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,450
are making your pitch
better.

258
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,640
The other thing,

259
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,100
that's the positive way of
looking at it.

260
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,050
The negative way of looking
at it,

261
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,750
or the cautionary lesson, is
that this gets me in

262
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,050
trouble every single time I
say it but

263
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,370
I'm on a ton of flu
medications so

264
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,530
I'm going to go ahead,.

265
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,320
And just let it rip.

266
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,590
Raising venture capital is

267
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,870
the easiest thing a startup
founder is ever going to do.
