529
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs
when I joined I was the 27th
employee.

530
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,690
When I left two and

531
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,060
a half years later we only had
57 employees.

532
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,380
In contrast when I joined
Square as a 20th employee,

533
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,507
two and a half years later, we
had like 250,300 employees.

534
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,176
So each company has it's own
velocity on this curve, and

535
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,844
if the company's going like
this,

536
00:18:57,844 --> 00:19:00,179
you can only keep people in
the roles that their own

537
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,500
personal learning curve is
going like this.

538
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,740
On the other hand, if the
company's growing like this,

539
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
anybody whose learning curve
is faster than that,

540
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,080
you can keep giving them the
same role to do.

541
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,300
So always track like the
individual slope of,

542
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,660
of an employee, and the
company's growth rate.

543
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,740
Now you have your barrels
identified, so

544
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,500
you're pick out the people
that can really take an idea

545
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,940
that you have in the back of
your head scope it out,

546
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,410
run with it, make it happen,
ship it,

547
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,790
and it's perfect, where do you
aim these barrels?

548
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,400
So I'm going to argue that you
really need to spend a lot of

549
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,260
time focusing people.

550
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
This is something I've learned
from Peter Thiel, actually.

551
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,590
He used to insist the PayPal,
that every single person could

552
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,810
only do exactly one thing and
we all rebelled.

553
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,890
Every single person in the
company rebelled to this idea.

554
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,310
Because it's so unnatural,
it's so different than every

555
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,070
other company where people
want to do multiple things,

556
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,317
and especially as you get more
senior you want to definitely

557
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,220
want to do multiple things,
and you're, you're like,

558
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,810
you feel like insulting to be
asked to do just one thing,

559
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,460
and Peter would enforce this
pretty strictly.

560
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,300
He'd basically say I will not
talk to you about anything

561
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,320
else except this one thing
I've assigned to you.

562
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,380
I don't want to hear about how
great you're doing over here.

563
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,620
Like just shut up, and peer
would run away and

564
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,410
then focus until you conquer
this one problem, and

565
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,950
the insight behind this is
that most people will

566
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,970
solve problems that they
understand how to solve.

567
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,689
Roughly speaking, they will
solve B

568
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,711
plus problems instead of A
plus problems.

569
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,470
A plus problems are high
impact problems for

570
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,960
your company, but they're
difficult.

571
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,910
You don't wake up in the
morning with a solution, so

572
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,290
you tend to procrastinate
them.

573
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,690
So imagine you wake up in the
morning,

574
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,790
you create a list of things to
do today.

575
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,890
There's usually the A plus 1
at the top of the list but

576
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,390
you never get around to it,
and so

577
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,550
you solve the second and
third, and over

578
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,030
an entire company of hundreds
of people that just cascades.

579
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,050
So you have a company that's
always solving B plus things.

580
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,192
Which does mean you grow and
does mean you add value.

581
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,710
But you never really create
that breakthrough idea because

582
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,226
no one is spending 100% of
their time banging their head

583
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,254
against the wall every day
until they solve it.

584
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:51,487
So I highly recommend some
version of that.

585
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:52,973
You can be less stringent.

586
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,447
You can be like you can get.

587
00:20:54,447 --> 00:20:57,465
Three things to work on, but
there, I would still track at

588
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,240
least the concept of what
would happen if you only gave

589
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,170
everybody one thing to
prioritize.

590
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,260
Now, because you can't make
decisions, you don't want be

591
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,440
making all these decisions
yourself, you have to

592
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,060
create tools that enable
people to make decisions.

593
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,780
At the same level ideally of
fidelity that you would make

594
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,770
them yourself.

595
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,390
So how do you create scale and
leverage?

596
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,570
First, thing I'd recommend is
building a dashboard.

597
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,910
This is an old square
dashboard.

598
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,210
It actually looks pretty
presentable even today.

599
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,090
The construct of a dashboard,
first of all,

600
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,340
should be drafted by a
founder.

601
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,190
You need to basically simplify
the value proposition in

602
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,620
the company's metrics for
success on a whiteboard.

603
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,140
You can have other people
build the dashboard,

604
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,770
I don't actually care about
that, but

605
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,760
you need to draw it out.

606
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,450
Like what does business
success look, look to us and

607
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,670
what are the key inputs to
those, and then

608
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,580
have someone create something
that is very intuitive for

609
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,410
every single person in

610
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,940
the company including customer
support to use.

611
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,920
And then,

612
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,560
the key metric of whether
you've succeeded is what

613
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,200
fraction of your employees use
that dashboard every day.

614
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,240
If it's actually useful it
should be close to 100%.

615
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,910
It's not going to be probably
100%,

616
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,120
but you want to measure that.

617
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,740
Just like you have quality
scores for

618
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,460
all your other KPIs with
users,

619
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,200
the dashboard needs to be as
intuitive as it is

620
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,780
as your product is for users.

621
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,630
Other things, wait, hold on.

622
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,210
Yeah, let's go back, one
second.

623
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,810
Another concept is
transparency.

624
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,720
And people will often.

625
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,220
That's weird.

626
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,690
Okay.

627
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,340
Transparency, people talk a
lot about.

628
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,440
It's kind of a goal that
everybody ascribes to, but

629
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,110
when push comes to

630
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,340
shove very few people actually
adhere to it.

631
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,660
So let me walk through a
little bit of transparency and

632
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,050
different stages of
transparency.

633
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,080
Metrics are the first step.

634
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,000
So everybody in your company
absolutely should have

635
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
access to every single thing
that's going on.

636
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,790
Other things that I like to do
are take your board decks, and

637
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,390
as you get more formal, the
board decks will get

638
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,890
more complicated, and actually
review every single slide with

639
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,080
every single employee after
the board meeting.

640
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,120
You can strip out the
compensation information if

641
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,270
you really want to.

642
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,860
But every other slide you
should go

643
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,390
through with the entire
employee base and explain it.

644
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,960
And if you can remember some
of the feedback you

645
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,440
got from your board that's
really cool to pass on.

646
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,810
Another thing we did at
Square,

647
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,990
as your company skills,

648
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,675
everybody's not going to get
invited to every meeting, but

649
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,590
they want to go to every
meeting.

650
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,540
The way you scale that is you
create notes for

651
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,810
every meeting and you send it
to the entire company.

652
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,250
So we created a notes at alias
for

653
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,510
every single meeting involving
more than two people,

654
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,140
someone would write notes and
send it to the entire company.

655
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,640
So people felt like as the
company added employees,

656
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,990
they could continue to monitor
and

657
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,580
track what was interesting,
what was going on,

658
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,160
and they never felt excluded,
hopefully.

659
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,730
The other thing is

660
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,900
like even the details around
conference rooms.

661
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,580
Every conference room at
Square has glass walls,

662
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,210
because as soon as you have
regular walls,

663
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,870
people wonder what's going on.

664
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,910
It's amazing, like if they can
see who's actually in

665
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,530
the meeting, and who's meeting
with who and when.

666
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,920
They don't worry nearly as
much as

667
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,170
what's going on behind those
closed doors.

668
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,860
Stripe, you may have seen a
blog post, but I

669
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,630
think Patrick wrote it, about
email transparency, about

670
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,010
actually allowing everybody to
have access to email.

671
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,490
That's pretty far out there
but

672
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,170
it's actually got interesting,
you know,

673
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,890
certain merits to it.

674
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,890
I would all call the tactics
that you read about

675
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,880
here about as sort of minimal
viable transparency.

676
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,240
I actually think you could
push the envelope a lot more.

677
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,790
Steve Jobs tried this at Next.

678
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,710
He actually tried transparent
compensation.

679
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,500
I actually think, although
Next didn't do extremely well,

680
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,510
the real reason wasn't because
of the experiment around

681
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,220
compensation transparency and

682
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,160
then there's a lot of error to
that.

683
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,170
The critique of compensation
transparency is often well.

684
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,410
We want people to be teammates
and

685
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,480
work together and collaborate.

686
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
And if you look in the sports
world, though,

687
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,670
where people are actually
teammates and

688
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,440
they do have to collaborate,

689
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,250
all of their compensation is
completely public.

690
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,500
In fact, each of us can look
up anybody's compensation in

691
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,320
the sports world and

692
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,890
get it exactly accurate, and
somehow it seems to work.

693
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,030
So I'm not totally bought in

694
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,570
to the idea that you need to
keep transpar-,

695
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,100
compensation non transparent.

696
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,780
Then finally metrics.

697
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,070
So you want to measure things.

698
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,100
You want to measure outputs,
not inputs.

699
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,970
And again, you should dictate
this yourself.

700
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,810
You should draft the dashboard
to tie this all together.

701
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,280
One important concept are what
are known as

702
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,310
pairing metrics or pairing
indicators,

703
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,420
which is if you measure one
thing and only one thing.

704
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,640
The company tends to optimize
to that, and often at

705
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,540
the expense of something else
that's important.

706
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,190
A costly example in payments
and

707
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,100
financial service is around
risk.

708
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,300
It's really easy to give the
risk team an objective and

709
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,080
say, we want to lower our
fraud rate.

710
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,470
It sounds great.

711
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,470
Until they start treating
every single user in

712
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,310
this audience as a suspect
user because they

713
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,540
want to lower their fog rate.

714
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,100
So they require each of you to
call them up on the phone and

715
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,720
give them more supplemental
information and

716
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,860
fax in things and

717
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,060
you have the lowest fraud rate
in the world,

718
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,300
you also have the worst, you
know,

719
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,360
sort of customer satisfaction
score.

720
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,780
So what you want to measure at
the same time as

721
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
your fraud rate is your false
positive rate.

722
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,960
That forces the team to
actually innovate.

723
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,700
Similarly, you

724
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,890
can give recruiters metrics
around hiring, and guess what?

725
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,910
You'll have a lot of people
come in through interviews,

726
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,850
but if you're not tracking the
quality of hires,

727
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,700
you may be very unhappy with
the quality of people you're

728
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,350
interviewing or the people
you're giving offers to.

729
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,240
So, you always want to create
the opposite as

730
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,170
an indication and measure
both, and the people that

731
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,750
are responsible for that team,
need to be measured for both.

732
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,340
Finally around metrics, one
insight I've had over my

733
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,530
career is what you, you kind
of want to look for

734
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,920
the anomalies.

735
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,940
You don't actually want to
look for

736
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,380
the expected behavior.

737
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,150
So that a famous example was
at PayPal.

738
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,580
None of the top ten markets
that

739
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,300
the company was planning to go
after included eBay.

740
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,440
But one day, someone noticed
that 54 Power Sellers had

741
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,090
actually handwritten into
their eBay listings,

742
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,010
please pay me with PayPal, and
brought this to

743
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,520
the attention of the executive
team at the time.

744
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,100
The first reaction of the
executive team was,

745
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,060
what the hell's going on?

746
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,530
Let's kick them out of the
system.

747
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,409
That's not our focus.

748
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,300
Fortunately, I think David
Sacks came back the next day

749
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,970
said, I think we found our
market.

750
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,730
Let's actually build tools for
these power sellers instead of

751
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,600
forcing them to write into
their listing,

752
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,530
pay me with PayPal.

753
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,010
Why don't we have an HTML
button that they can

754
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,560
just insert?

755
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,430
Well that started to work.

756
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,950
And then he said,

757
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,660
well actually why do we make
them insert it.

758
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,170
Why should we make them insert
it all the time?

759
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,700
Why don't we just

760
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,090
automatically insert it for
them?

761
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,360
So they could just insert it
once and

762
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,770
then every single listing they
have forever.

763
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,590
It'll just automagically
appear there.

764
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,810
So that became the success for
PayPal.

765
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,360
Similarly, I was at LinkedIn,

766
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,460
and I saw this stat that made
no sense to me.

767
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,920
The UI for the site was a
little bit different back

768
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,710
then, but 25% of all clicks,
maybe 30% of all clicks

769
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,490
from the home page were people
going to their own profile.

770
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,290
And that made no sense
whatsoever.

771
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,770
I mean like, the set, it was a
settings,

772
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,920
like you had to literally go
to the right margin.

773
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,730
Final a link and it was 25 to
30% of every single click at

774
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,490
scale I mean so this is like
statistically novel stuff.

775
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,590
And it made no sense
whatsoever,

776
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,055
never seen like the UI perform
that way.

777
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:35,320
And, I kind of went around for
weeks trying to

778
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,460
figure this out and then
someone very smart.

779
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,850
Actually, it's Max Letchin
said something to me and

780
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,219
I was like, he's like it's
vanity.

781
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,190
And I'm like ha people

782
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,720
are looking at themselves in
the mirror.

783
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,940
That's pretty good answer.

784
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,530
So cause they weren't editing
their profile.

785
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,280
Nobody has like something to
edit everyday in

786
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,110
their profile.

787
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,650
But they actually were just
looking in themselves in

788
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,880
the mirror everyday because it
made them feel good.

789
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,870
And then you can actually test
that hypothesis and

790
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,280
say, well, if I had more
content.

791
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,730
Do I look at myself in the
mirror more often?

792
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,360
Turns out you did.
