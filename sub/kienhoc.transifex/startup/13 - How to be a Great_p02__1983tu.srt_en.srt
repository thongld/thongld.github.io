244
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,750
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7ZvO5DpIw
contrarian is also is always,

245
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,400
actually this is one of the
things that Sam and

246
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,520
I talked about at startup
school is contrarian is

247
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,380
actually relative to an
audience, right?

248
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,240
So.

249
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,178
When you want to be, when
you're,

250
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:54,220
when you're thinking about
contrarian in terms of,

251
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,300
like a really good contrarian
idea is like okay,

252
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,660
what would other, say it's
consumer Internet,

253
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,570
good consumer Internet people
think is actually in

254
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,995
fact not yet a good idea.

255
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,930
And part of what you think
about contrarian is to say,

256
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,590
okay, what's the way that what
do

257
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,950
I know that other people don't
know?

258
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,120
Because it isn't just that I'm
brilliant and

259
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,130
other people aren't and

260
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,040
that's reason why contrarian
thing is right.

261
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,610
That's a very bad test.

262
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,570
Right, it happened to be true.

263
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,190
Of course, lightening could
also strike you in the field.

264
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,200
You know, so, think a lot
about, like,

265
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,160
what is that I know that other
people don't know?

266
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,520
So, for example, in the very
early days of LinkedIn,

267
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,860
part of what I advised all
founders to do was go talk to

268
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,290
every smart person who will
talk to you and

269
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,450
give you feedback.

270
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,740
So, at LinkedIn I walked
around and

271
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,780
said here's my idea, what do
you think?

272
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,520
Two thirds or more of my
network, including some of

273
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,080
the very, very smart people,
all thought I was nuts.

274
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,610
And they reason why they
thought I was nuts was because

275
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,500
they said well look, it's a
network product, it's only

276
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,230
valuable with a bunch of
people in it, first person no

277
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,490
value, invite second person,
second person first person,

278
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,740
no value for either of them,
they already know each other.

279
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,470
When do you,

280
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,890
when do you actually begin to
deliver on your use case.

281
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,520
Which is like 500k to a
million people.

282
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,110
Right.

283
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,920
And so, you're never going to
get to size,

284
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,150
you're never going to grow.

285
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,710
Now what I knew that the
critique,

286
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,790
the critics didn't know.

287
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,180
Was that I could think of a
set of different ways by which

288
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,900
people could say, look it's
pretty easy to say, look I

289
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,840
believe in the vision of this,
or I think it's interesting,

290
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,290
or I think a product like this
should exist, or

291
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm willing to play around
with it and I can use,

292
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,160
leverage, those sets of
interests to grow the network,

293
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,210
to get to enough size that you
could begin to deliver on

294
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,110
the value propositions in
which LinkedIn had.

295
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,020
And that was the specific
thing that I knew

296
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,700
that the critics weren't
thinking about.

297
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,320
And so when you think about
being contrarian, you have to

298
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,180
think about how is it that
smart people disagree with me?

299
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,200
They disagree with me from a
position of

300
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,250
intelligence right.

301
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,940
And there's something that I
know that they don't

302
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,680
know that actually in fact
will play out to be true.

303
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,110
Now, in this case, in general
as a, as a founder it's good

304
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,580
to be contrarian in the real
sense and right.

305
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,260
Now the other last part on the
contrariness is to think about

306
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,090
there's a lot of different
ways to be contrarian.

307
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,580
So for example, a frequent one
will be is like, oh yeah,

308
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,720
that's a good small idea but
actually not so

309
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,030
small it's large.

310
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,990
Or you know, actually in fact
you can assemble the talent or

311
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,080
while most consumer internet
start ups tend to be like for

312
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,829
example, this is another
LinkedIn example tend to be

313
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,970
only successful through rocket
ships.

314
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,240
Actually a gradual compounding
curve can actually be very,

315
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,610
very valuable.

316
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,050
LinkedIn never had its rocket
ship moment.

317
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,950
It was, it was kind of
compound year by year.

318
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,290
But that in the consumer
internet,

319
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,900
tends to be a atypical to the
pattern.

320
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,350
So here you begin to get to a
bunch of sorts of

321
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,580
problems that, essentially
founders run into,

322
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,910
which is like, well should I
be doing the work or

323
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,590
should be recruiting people
and delegating the work.

324
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,990
And classically the answer to
this is,

325
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,900
actually in fact you need to
do both.

326
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,450
Right, and, in fact, not only
do you need to do both,

327
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,520
you need to do sometimes one
at 100% and

328
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,210
sometimes the other one at
100%.

329
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,290
And sometimes, even though
this is not so

330
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,400
good at math, both at 100%.

331
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,820
And so what you'll see is,
this is actually classic

332
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,970
when you begin thinking about
what is a great founder?

333
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,160
Is you navigate what is
apparent paradoxes?

334
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,290
So another one that I
frequently talk about is,

335
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,570
you got to be both flexible
and persistent.

336
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,920
And the reason for this is,

337
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,720
entrepreneurs are frequently
given the advice to, you know,

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,790
have a vision.

339
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,650
Stay firm against adversity.

340
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,940
You know, realize that you,
you have this vision that

341
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,440
is contrarian to what other
people think, and

342
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,640
just ho, stay on track,

343
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,910
get through the difficult
times, and get there.

344
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,270
The other piece of advice
given with equal vigor is,

345
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,790
listen to data, listen to
customers.

346
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,951
pivot.
Be flexible!

347
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,912
Part of the thing this comes
out to meaning in terms of

348
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,998
being a great founder is to
say well,

349
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:51,270
when should I be persistent,
when should I be flexible?

350
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,100
And the, the vehicle that I
most often use for

351
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,870
this is you should have on a
project you're doing,

352
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,470
like a company, an investment
thesis that essentially says

353
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,470
why you think possibly
contrarian.

354
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,320
Why you think this is a
potentially good idea.

355
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,210
It should include what you
know that you

356
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,260
think other people don't know
and then, as you're

357
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,980
going into the battlefield,
you go is, you know, am I

358
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,300
in fact increasing confidence
in my investment pieces or

359
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
decreasing confidence in my
investment pieces?

360
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,050
Because I've got increasing
confidence, then oh,

361
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,840
stay on track, you know, be
persistent.

362
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,850
And by the way, sometimes even
with adversity,

363
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,510
you're confidence can, can
increase.

364
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,580
If it's decreasing, that
doesn't mean jump out.

365
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,120
PayPal, LinkedIn, Airbnb,

366
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,430
a whole bunch of startups I've
been I've been a part of have

367
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,840
had months where you were
like, oh my God this,

368
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,340
why would did we ever think
this was a good idea it

369
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,270
was kind of a valley of the
shadows moment.

370
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,640
So like example, in PayPal it
was, you know,

371
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,980
August 2000 we were burning
$12 million in one month,

372
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,880
the expense curve was
exponentiating,

373
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,100
we had no revenue, decrease in
confidence,

374
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,560
however we say okay what we do
in order to fix that, and

375
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,290
that gives you your immediate
action plan.

376
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,930
Another one is, should you
have belief or

377
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,090
should you have fear?

378
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,950
Right, should you have, you
know,

379
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,590
should you essentially go well
no I have this vision of

380
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,690
the way the world should be
and

381
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,030
I should ignore everything
else and

382
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,710
I should just go at that.

383
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,200
Well again, part of what being
a great founder is,

384
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,020
is being both able to hold the
belief, to think about what it

385
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,270
is you want to be doing and
want to, want to be going.

386
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,150
But also be smart enough that
you're essentially listening

387
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,200
to criticism, negative
feedback, competitive entries,

388
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,810
where you're kind of going
okay,

389
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,570
is this changing my investment
thesis?

390
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,360
Is this changing what I'm
planning on doing?

391
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,620
It doesn't mean you lose
confidence.

392
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,063
You have the confidence, but

393
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,915
you also essentially have the
peril.

394
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,141
Again, in this kind of thing
of how do you put these two

395
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:48,776
things together, should I
focus internally, build

396
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:51,835
the product, ignore the world,
ignore competitors etc.,

397
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,530
.
or should I focus externally?

398
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,410
Should I be recruiting?

399
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,310
Should I be meeting people?

400
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,170
Should I be gathering network
intelligence?

401
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,840
Again, the answer is both.

402
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,990
And the reason why I'm
focusing on these kind of

403
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,220
it's, it's both rather than
either or, is because part of

404
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,820
what makes a great founder is
the ability to,

405
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,780
to, to be flexible across
these lines.

406
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,630
To sometimes be 90% one way,

407
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,080
sometimes be 80% the other
way.

408
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,880
Be executing the judgement on

409
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,680
what is the current problem
look like.

410
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,500
How is it that when I'm trying
to solve this,

411
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,690
that I should say, this is
what we should be doing and

412
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,500
how should I be dividing the
work?

413
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,280
And part of, when you think
about these things, and

414
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,010
you just say like this is

415
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,270
another one that's kind of
classic is people say, well,.

416
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,425
I'm completely motivated by
data.

417
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:36,500
It's what customers say at the
user groups.

418
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,440
You know?
I've,

419
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,330
a lot of entrepreneurial
methodologies lean,

420
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,320
other kinds of things are
talked about is like,

421
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,440
gather the data, be guided on
the data.

422
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,010
Well actually in fact, data
only exists within

423
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,770
a framework of the vision that
you're building to

424
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,260
a hypothesis of where you're
moving to.

425
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,050
And the data can even be
negative and

426
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,480
you can think, well actually
in fact,

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,530
this negative data means that
I need to change, or

428
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,710
alter the way that I'm
thinking about something.

429
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,190
But I actually keep on a
specific vision about

430
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,210
what I'm doing.

431
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,910
And, and by the way,

432
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,390
sometimes even when you have
that specific vision,

433
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,110
you don't necessarily
actually, you never end up at

434
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,680
that big vision that you were
thinking about.

435
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,178
So for example, you know, at
PayPal we distributed these

436
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:18,720
t-shirts that said the new
global world currency, right?

437
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,250
Well actually in fact one of
the, the and I,

438
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,570
and I know Peter's been here.

439
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,880
One of the jokes I told Peter
is like well actually we do

440
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,150
have this new world global
currency.

441
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,520
What we're trading in is
dollars.

442
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,100
You may have heard of it, it's
existed for a while.

443
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,680
Right?

444
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,030
We're essentially a master
merchant for that.

445
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,540
now, course this message is
what may be happening with

446
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,760
BitCoin although, you know, is
a whole other topic there.

447
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,650
However, the key thing is that
that vision of saying, we're

448
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,780
creating a kind of a universal
network that allows anyone to,

449
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,030
to pay, anyone to become a
merchant.

450
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,480
To bring the electronics into
the speed of commerce at

451
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,890
any business that, that is
being transacted.

452
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,690
That vision kept at true north
by, we say well,

453
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,280
first we think we're going to
have a banking model.

454
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,250
Then we think we're going to
have, you know, a, a,

455
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,820
a debt model.

456
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,970
Oh no, we're actually going to
have a master merchant model.

457
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,260
And how does that actually
play out?

458
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,950
So you're always combining the
vision and the data.

459
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,830
And the data's within the
framework of, of a vision.

460
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,820
And sometimes, of course, what
you learn changes your vision.

461
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,410
Now, this is one of the ones I
actually think we,

462
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,200
we, we saved this special
picture for

463
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,960
one of the ones that I
actually think is quite key.

464
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,340
Is that normally
entrepreneurs, founders,

465
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,730
are thought about as having
like the risk takers, right?

466
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,020
They're, they're, they, they,
whereas everyone else cowers

467
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,780
in fear from this notion of
risk they boldly go out.

468
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
Now, that's true.

469
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,560
You have to be a risk taker.

470
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,520
You have to be thinking about
how do I

471
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,250
make a really coherent bet on
risk because in fact,

472
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,310
the only really big
opportunities, the only

473
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,790
contrarian opportunities that
smart people disagree with you

474
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,910
on happen to be ones that have
risk associated with them.

475
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,410
On the other hand, part of the
skill set that when

476
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,680
you're beginning to apply how
you think about risks as

477
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
an entrepreneur is you're
beginning to

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,750
think about like how do I take
intelligent risks.

479
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,150
How do I take a focused risk
that if I'm right about that

480
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,710
one thing then a bunch of
other things break my way.

481
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,453
And once I start doing that, I
try to figure out how to

482
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:21,600
make my, my, on shot
possibility as high as

483
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,681
possible eg how do I minimize
other risks?

484
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,622
How do I essentially take this
risk in an intelligent way

485
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:29,670
that doesn't just go oh yeah
risk.

486
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,350
Risk to the wind.
