593
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,820
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE
wanna help bring the world
together.

594
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,780
We wanna do that by giving a
sense of

595
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,240
belonging anywhere you go.

596
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,530
So our mission is to belong
anywhere.

597
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,420
So five years from now, 20
years from now, maybe we're

598
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,330
still selling rooms and
homes but maybe we're not.

599
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,950
But I can guarantee you what
we're always gonna be about.

600
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,880
It's a sense of belonging
and bringing people together

601
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
and that's the more enduring
idea.

602
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,540
So when we hire people the
first thing we need to

603
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,410
make sure is if that's our
mission you need to

604
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,580
champion that mission.

605
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,960
You champion the mission by
living the mission.

606
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,580
Do you believe in it?

607
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,840
Do you have stories about
it?

608
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,970
Have you used the product?

609
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,550
Would you bleed for the
product?

610
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,340
I used to ask like, crazy
questions like, one of the,

611
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,930
the cra-crazy question Sam
reminds me of is I used to

612
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,120
interview people.

613
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,180
So, I interview the first
300 employees at

614
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,060
Airbnb which people think
I'm like neurotic and

615
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,330
that may also be true.

616
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,000
But and I use to ask them a
question.

617
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,030
Which I've now amended.

618
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,220
I use to ask them, if you
had a year left to live,

619
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,850
would you take this job?

620
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,187
And actually, the people who
say yes to that,

621
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:14,983
you probably don't want.

622
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,581
Cuz that's, like,

623
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,910
they should spend time with
your family.

624
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,700
>> So I amended it to ten
years.'

625
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,480
Cuz I feel like you should,
you, whatever.

626
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,230
If you knew you had ten
years left to live.

627
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,540
Whatever you want, you would
do in those last ten years,

628
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,950
you should just do.

629
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,430
And, and I really wanted
people to think about that.

630
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,960
That was enough time for,
like,

631
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,800
you to do something you
really cared about.

632
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,630
And the answer doesn't have
to be this company.

633
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,380
I say, fine.

634
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,368
If the you're meant to do is
to travel, or

635
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:37,783
if you're meant to do is
start a company,

636
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,090
you should just do that.

637
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,860
Don't come here.

638
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,100
Go do that.

639
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,120
And so there's this old kind
of parable probably many

640
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,070
of you heard of it.

641
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,790
About like two men are
laying brick.

642
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,620
Somebody comes up to

643
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,910
the first man says what are
you doing?

644
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,880
He says I'm building a wall.

645
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,410
He asks the other guy what
are you doing?

646
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,340
He says I'm building a
cathedral.

647
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,420
There's a job and then
there's a calling.

648
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,180
And we want to

649
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,530
hire people that aren't just
looking for jobs.

650
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,490
They're looking for a
calling.

651
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,230
And that's, that's kinda the
first value and

652
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,080
that's to champion the
mission.

653
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll just, maybe,

654
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,630
cuz I don't want to just
take all the time up.

655
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,880
I'll, I'll talk about,

656
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,380
I'll talk about just one
more, just so

657
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,160
we don't talk the whole
thing up just about values.

658
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,640
The second value relates to
being kinda creative and

659
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,880
frugal, and I'll tell you a
story.

660
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,140
Our company was like.

661
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,700
By the way, all the founding
stories in your company end

662
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,640
up becoming the things that
people repeat and

663
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,470
talk about when you're a
1,000 people.

664
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,593
And it kinda embodies,
right,

665
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:23,720
its kinda like your
childhood.

666
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,650
These things kinda come back
later in life.

667
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,810
Same thing with a company.

668
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,800
So Airbnb, I think Mark said
in the last talk that was

669
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,660
like the worst idea that
ever worked and.

670
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,910
It, it, it really probably
was the worst idea, I mean,

671
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,530
people thought we were
crazy.

672
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,300
I remember telling people
about the idea.

673
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,980
And I remember actually
telling Paul Graham,

674
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,910
we have this idea, in our
interview,

675
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,520
we have this idea, it's
called Airbnb.

676
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,060
He goes, people actually
doing this?

677
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,720
I go, yeah.

678
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,400
His follow up question was,
what's wrong with them?

679
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,280
So I knew the interview
wasn't going well,

680
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,300
And in the, at the end of
the interview, Paul Graham,

681
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,320
I think, wasn't going to
accept us.

682
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,660
And, but we told him the
story of

683
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,770
how we funded the company.

684
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,270
And here's how it goes.

685
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,870
We were introduced, Michael
Siebel,

686
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,000
who I believe he's a partner
of Y-Com.

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
To let people know,
introduced me and

688
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,920
Joe to like 15 investors in
the Valley,

689
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,630
including some of the ones
that have been here.

690
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,150
And all of them like said no
to the company.

691
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,890
They could have bought 10%
of the company for

692
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,204
like 100, $150,000.

693
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,288
They all said no.

694
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:20,570
They thought it was a crazy
idea.

695
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,820
No one would ever stay in
someone's home.

696
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,900
So we ended up

697
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,010
just funding the company
with credit cards.

698
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,390
And you know those binders
pe,

699
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,400
kids use to put baseball
cards in?

700
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,570
So we put credit cards in
those.

701
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,550
>> Cuz we had to put them
all somewhere.

702
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,830
That's how many credit cards
we had.

703
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,740
And we were completely in
debt.

704
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,980
And in the fall of 2008 we
provided housing for

705
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,680
the Democratic and

706
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,040
Republican national
convention and.

707
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,820
We had this weird crazy idea
cuz we

708
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,400
weren't really selling a lot
of homes.

709
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,770
So basically Airbnb launched
and a year after we

710
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,430
launched I think we had a
hundred people a day

711
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,240
visiting our website and we
had like two bookings.

712
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,082
Which is generally bad.

713
00:24:58,082 --> 00:24:59,570
It's kinda like releasing a
song and a year

714
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,200
later like three people
listen to it every day.

715
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,490
Like it's probably not going
to be a very popular song.

716
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,670
So, but I believed in it and
Joe and

717
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,140
Nate believed in it but And
so

718
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,060
we were completely in debt,
we don't know what to do.

719
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,490
And so we get this idea well
we're air bed and breakfast,

720
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,260
we're providing housing for
the Democratic and

721
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,810
Republican national
conventions.

722
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,670
What if we made like a
collectible breakfast cereal

723
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,040
for like the Democratic
national convention.

724
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,540
And we came up with this
Obama,

725
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,930
Barack Obama theme cereal.

726
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,550
We called it Obama-Os the
breakfast of change.

727
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,180
And then we came up with a
Republican theme, so for

728
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,770
John McCain, we found out
he's a captain in the Navy,

729
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,530
so we came up with?

730
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,090
Captain McCain's.

731
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,090
A maverick in every bite.

732
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,960
And we had 0 dollars, and
without any money,

733
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,660
we were able to, we tried to
call, like, General Mills.

734
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,630
And they told us to, like,
stop calling them, or

735
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,730
they're getting restraining
orders, so that didn't work.

736
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,880
But we found a local alumni
of RISD; he made 1,000 boxes

737
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,050
of cereal for us.

738
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,840
And we end up sending them
to press, and eventually,

739
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,220
within a week, we got on
national television,

740
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,370
national news.

741
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,220
We made $40,000 selling
breakfast cereal.

742
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,810
And that, the year 2008,

743
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,940
we made $5,000 from our
website, and

744
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,890
we made $40,000 selling the
breakfast cereal.

745
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,560
And I remember my mom asking
me,

746
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,010
so are you a cereal company
now?

747
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,270
And that wasn't the bad
part.

748
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,030
The bad part was the oddest
answer.

749
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,860
Which was well, but the
reason I tell that,

750
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,799
is our second core value is
to be a serial entrepreneur.

751
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,576
I'm sorry for the cheesy
pun.

752
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,141
I'm sorry.

753
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:34,400
But be a serentrepreneur.

754
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,370
And we really mean that we
believe constraints bring

755
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,110
out creativity.

756
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,015
And when you raise like $800
million,

757
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:43,280
suddenly all that
scrappiness.

758
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,740
It's easy to lose that
scrappiness.

759
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,070
It's easier for people to
tell you, you know,

760
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,950
I just need this like
$50,000 contract or

761
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,410
I need this or I need that.

762
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,470
And whenever somebody
just,is just being a little

763
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,930
bit not, like frugal and not
being creative.

764
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,490
Or they tell me they can't
do something,

765
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,570
I'll just take a box of
cereal.

766
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,350
And, like,

767
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,100
even just a suggestion of
Obama knows they need to

768
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,440
be scrappy and frugal.

769
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,980
And so again, a lot of the
founding DNA of your company

770
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,400
becomes these values, these
principles.

771
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,420
And so, everyone knows,

772
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,730
if you don't give a crap,
you shouldn't be here.

773
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,330
And it doesn't mean you have
to give a crap.

774
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,380
It just means you have to,
to be here.

775
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,030
And you also have to be
creative and

776
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,220
be like, kinda like an
entrepreneur.

777
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,910
Super scrappy.

778
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,020
And these are some of the
values we learn.

779
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:22,750
>> Cool.

780
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,440
So you guys should start,

781
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,520
start thinking about
questions.

782
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,760
I'm gonna open up to
questions from the audience.

783
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,180
But I have a few more
questions for you.

784
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,120
>> Yeah.
>> So,.

785
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,060
This all sounds nice.

786
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,950
The stories are great.

787
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,520
>> Yep.

788
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,150
>> People here are a pretty
skeptical group.

789
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:35,870
>> Yep.
>> It's

790
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,960
a CS Department class.

791
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,530
>> Yep.
>> Probably left

792
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,660
brain focused.

793
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,587
>> Yep.
>> Feels like

794
00:27:39,587 --> 00:27:41,022
a softy kinda right brain
focus.

795
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:42,052
>> I'm a total softy.

796
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:44,511
Sorry.

797
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:49,461
>> But how has having your
strong culture helped you

798
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,652
make important tough
decisions?

799
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:55,438
>> Well, I think that having
a, so

800
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:58,440
here's the thing about
culture.

801
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,650
There's three things they
never tell you

802
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,700
about culture.

803
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,130
The first thing is they
never tell you anything.

804
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,440
In other words, no one ever
talks about culture, and

805
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,910
no one ever tells you you
need to have strong culture.

806
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,230
And so, like there's tons of

807
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,790
articles about building a
great product.

808
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,910
There's tons of articles
about

809
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,020
like growth and adoption.

810
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,550
And there's very few things
about culture.

811
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,720
It's this like mystical
thing that's like kinda

812
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,940
soft and fuzzy.

813
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,990
That's the first problem.

814
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,500
The second problem is it's
hard to measure.

815
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,250
And things that get,

816
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,820
are hard to measure often
get discounted.

817
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,040
And these are like two
really hard things.

818
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,670
But the third thing is the
biggest problem.

819
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,900
The biggest problem of
culture,

820
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,800
is it doesn't pay off in the
short-term.

821
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,690
In fact, if you wanted to,
in one year,

822
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,970
build a company and sell it
as quickly as possible.

823
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,860
The number one piece of
advice I give you is,

824
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,640
fuck up the culture.

825
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,310
Forget about it, just hire
people quickly.

826
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,920
Culture makes you hire
really slowly and

827
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,820
makes you be deliberate
about decisions that in

828
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,800
the near term can slow
progress.

829
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,101
It's kinda like putting an
investment into

830
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:50,560
the company short-term.

831
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,070
And so, these are the things
people never tell you.

832
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,130
So it, it's really about
building a company for

833
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,590
the long-term and to endure.

834
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,680
Now, some of the things
about culture.

835
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,600
The first thing is you need
to

836
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,120
like be very clear about
like.

837
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,490
What's unique to you, that
you stand for?

838
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,460
Once you do that, you need
to

839
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,650
make sure you hire people
that believe in that.

840
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,360
And so we interviewed
hundreds of people.

841
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,890
You need to make sure that
you hire and

842
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,690
fire based on the ideas of
these values.

843
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,390
And, and, you know?

844
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,460
One of the things we do is
we

845
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,770
constantly repeat over and
over again.

846
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:20,910
So we interview.

847
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,190
Like, when we interview,

848
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,680
we wanna make sure they're
world class and

849
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,590
they fit the culture.

850
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,380
So, the first thing I used
to ask people,

851
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,390
I had at the end of an
interview sheet.

852
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,570
Is if you can hire.

853
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,680
This is a functional
question.

854
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,890
If you can hire anybody in
the world,

855
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,430
would you hire the person
sitting accords from you.

856
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,190
And if our, our vision if
become like the best of

857
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,720
what we do why dont we hire
the very best in the world.

858
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,750
So, every single person is
meant to

859
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,220
hire a person better than
the previous people.

860
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,000
You're constantly hiring,
raising the bar.

861
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,120
You're constantly hiring
world class people.

862
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,500
Then we have separate people
called core value people.

863
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,572
Who aren't in the function.

864
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:56,900
So if you're an engineer,
the core values

865
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,495
engineers interviewers are
never engineers.

866
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,298
Because we don't want them
to be biased and

867
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,808
say, oh, I know how good
they are.

868
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:04,528
And they interview just for
values,

869
00:30:04,528 --> 00:30:06,925
to make sure that people
care about the same thing.

870
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:10,300
And we've said no to a lot
of really great people.

871
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,600
Because we just didn't feel
right about them being with

872
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,720
us long term.

873
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,000
So that's one of the things.

874
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,682
I also think that maybe some
other

875
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:27,373
examples of when we kind of
had hard decisions.

876
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:30,699
In mid 2011 we had this.

877
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,778
So we were mostly in the
United States.

878
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,634
And we had this internet
clone funded by these guys

879
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,340
called the Samwer brothers.

880
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,890
Has anyone heard about the
Samwer brothers?

881
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,673
They basically, they clone.

882
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,464
Yeah Rocket Internet, they
just went public.

883
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,616
And they basically copy
American websites quickly,

884
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:46,370
and they try to sell it back
to you.

885
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,140
And if you don't, then they
just try to,

886
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,540
so it's kind of like putting
a gun to your head.

887
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,310
And so, and they had
basically done

888
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,320
this to Groupon.
