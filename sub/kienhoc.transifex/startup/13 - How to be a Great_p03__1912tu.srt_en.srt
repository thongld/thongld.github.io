487
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,270
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7ZvO5DpIw
Who cares?

488
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,830
But let's go.

489
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,560
And so this kind of combines
that, you know, this,

490
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,350
this image which I think is
the best of the,

491
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,320
of the, of, of the images we
found for

492
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,560
this yet, is kind of the sense
of how to think about.

493
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,489
Now, back to what I was saying
in terms of having

494
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:48,821
an investment thesis, part of
having an investment thesis

495
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,902
is, you chart it out, it's
kind of a list of bullets.

496
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,089
You say, like for example,

497
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,564
in early LinkedIn it was like
look everyone is actually

498
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,127
going to be benefited by
public professional network.

499
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,696
Everyone will realize
including companies that it's

500
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,758
better to have it play out
this way the initial set of

501
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:06,436
adoption will come from
essentially people who were

502
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:09,279
like visualize the role, thus
were willing to play with it,

503
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,621
and then eventually the mass
market will come on as

504
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,237
they begin to have a network
that is

505
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,510
already delivering a value
proposition to them.

506
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,520
That's what kind of

507
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,420
an investment thesis can look
like and then,

508
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,260
you know, you've got economics
like initial recruiting and

509
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,410
then, and then broadening and
other things.

510
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,000
You have that investment
thesis and

511
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,840
you say, is my investment
thesis increasing or

512
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,210
decreasing in confidence?

513
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,930
Do I think that the data I get
from the market,

514
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,950
when I talk to smart people,
how does that,

515
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,470
how does that change my
confidence in it?

516
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,850
And this is actually how you
essentially minimize risk.

517
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,910
So, for example, very early,
very early days in PayPal the,

518
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,900
part of what happened is, they
said,

519
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,180
okay well, we're going to do
cash on mobile phones.

520
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,200
We'll do cash on Palm Pilots
because it's really easy.

521
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,030
We actually realized that cash
on Palm Pilots wouldn't work

522
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,010
even before we launched the
product.

523
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,980
Because basically what
happened is,

524
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,520
I went in and said to Max and
Peter.

525
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,050
I said look here's our
challenge,

526
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,370
our challenge is, we're
probably doesn't remember what

527
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,950
Palm Pilot's are.

528
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,470
They were like, like early
PDAs And so

529
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,160
yeah we lived in what was Palm
Pilot central.

530
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,710
And the whole use case case
was splitting dinner tab.

531
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,930
And, how many people,

532
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,771
everyone at the table would
have a PalmPilot Zero to

533
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,780
one in every single
restaurant.

534
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,220
So, you could even just by
thinking it through,

535
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,430
you realize that the direction
you're on is

536
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,790
going to hit a minefield and
you need to pivot, and

537
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,510
that's when Max Legend came up
with the idea of saying,

538
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,110
actually in fact we could
synch by emails,

539
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,080
we could have email payments
as backbone of this, and

540
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,240
we were like oh, that's a good
idea.

541
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,970
And of course,

542
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,220
that's what the whole thing
kind of pivoted into.

543
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,930
And that's part of thinking
through minimizing the risks,

544
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,240
as you're actually executing.

545
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,140
Here's another one that's kind
of classic.

546
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,060
Which is, well, should I have
this long term vision?

547
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,520
Or should I be solving local,
near term problems?

548
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,860
And again, the answer is both.

549
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,760
It's these paradoxes and

550
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,790
the question is, is you jump
between them.

551
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,950
You should always have a long
term vision in mind because if

552
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,970
you actually completely lose
your, your directions

553
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,890
eventually you'll find
yourself in some field there's

554
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,260
not a good path out of, but if
you're not focused on solving

555
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,430
the problem that's immediately
in front of you, you're hosed.

556
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,170
Right.

557
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,150
And so part of the the
question about how you

558
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,358
put these things together is
you say, okay,

559
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:27,960
short term what's the thing I
need to be doing today?

560
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,030
Have I made progress today?

561
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,430
have I made progress this
week?

562
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,720
But is it largely on path?

563
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,040
So, I'll give you an example
of how this plays out in

564
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,230
terms of financing or in terms
of strategy.

565
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,340
So people frequently think
product strategy is

566
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,115
fundamental to how, start-ups.

567
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:44,660
Like I have a have a product
idea, that's a thing,

568
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm a founder.

569
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,780
Actually in fact, the next
level down on

570
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,490
strategy is usually a product
distribution.

571
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,450
Whether it's consumer Internet
or or enterprise or

572
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,290
anything else.

573
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,890
Because actually in fact no
matter how good your

574
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,060
product is, if it doesn't get
to customers you're hosed.

575
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,022
So usually you have to have
product distribution as

576
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,820
more fundamental than the
actually what the product is.

577
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,150
And the one below it is
financing.

578
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,180
And the reason why it's
financing is if you run out of

579
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,940
money and the whole effort
goes away,

580
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,140
even if you have a really good
idea it doesn't work.

581
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,150
So frequently when you're
executing on a good

582
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,430
strategy you're actually in
fact, when I'm raising money,

583
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,700
this fundraising, I'm thinking
about the next fundraising.

584
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm thinking about how I'm set
up for it, I'm establishing

585
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,330
relationships that would be
key to that and I'm,

586
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,880
I'm not executing like oh, the
only thing that matters is I

587
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,130
get to the next, is, is get to
the next fundraising because

588
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,970
you have this business that
you're building.

589
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,170
But I am thinking that as a
core strategy in

590
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,480
terms of how I'm executing and

591
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,920
frequently you're thinking
about okay, how does my

592
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,880
product distribution work such
that the financing works well?

593
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,630
And that's kind of how

594
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,090
you architect these things
together.

595
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,440
So how do you know if you
might be a great founder?

596
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,430
Well, it's, you should have
some superpowers.

597
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,250
It's generally speaking in

598
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,110
software useful to be a good
product person.

599
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,870
It's useful to have good
skills about kind of

600
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,610
leadership of bringing
networks in,

601
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,820
of persuading people.

602
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,780
And it's useful to be able to,

603
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,580
and this is kind of the most
fundamental,

604
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,290
is recognize whether or not
you're on track or not.

605
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,570
To have both that kind of
belief, but also

606
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,200
paranoia about, am I tracking
against my investment thesis?

607
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,390
And when you do that the right
way, and you're learning, and

608
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,720
you're assembling people, and

609
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,630
you're assembling networks
around you,

610
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,540
that's generally speaking,

611
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,970
how you end up being a great
founder.

612
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,160
Now, classically and

613
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,410
I deliberately put up five
white men, male pictures.

614
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,250
It's classically,

615
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,820
you have a kind of a these are
the iconic founders.

616
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,790
But in fact, founders can be
very diverse,

617
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,710
they can be extraordinarily
talented at

618
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,110
different areas because
there's different kinds of

619
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,000
entrepreneurial companies,
there's different kinds of

620
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
problems they're trying to
solve.

621
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,560
And I don't just mean
diversity in terms of classic,

622
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,450
you know, kind of gender,
race, et cetera.

623
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,350
I, diversity in age, diversity
in experience.

624
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,330
You know, Jack Baugh was a, a,
was a,

625
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,570
a teacher before he got into
this.

626
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,150
That's the kind of thing that
you can,

627
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,960
that you should think about.

628
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,780
And so the, the question is,

629
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,860
is how you cross uneven
ground.

630
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,290
How you assemble networks
around you.

631
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,670
How you get people to assemble
this,

632
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,800
it's a constantly changing
problem to face when you

633
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,458
are trying to found a company.

634
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:28,660
And so, I think that the thing
that I was trying

635
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,830
to get people to think about
with this is to say,

636
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,760
there's not one skill set.

637
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,940
There's an ability to learn
and adapt,

638
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,260
an ability to constantly have
a vision that's driving you,

639
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,160
but to be taking input from
all sources and

640
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,920
then to be cre, creating
networks around you,

641
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,870
and that's essentially what
makes a great founder.

642
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,900
And your ability to

643
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,350
do that while crossing uneven
ground in a fog.

644
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,070
Which is kind of the, the,
the, the way that

645
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,700
entrepreneurs, because you
don't really know like,

646
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,820
did you always know this was
going to work?

647
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,940
No.
Unless you are crazy.

648
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:01,520
Right.

649
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,470
Sometimes crazy works.

650
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,620
So with that I will now go to
a few questions.

651
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,840
But it was kind of this mind
set of founders.

652
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,559
Which is kind of key.

653
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,600
And if there's no ques, oh,
here.

654
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,090
>> I'm curious about how
Nathan, how you

655
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,570
you targeted the earlier, or
you selected the guys for

656
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,020
getting the right doctors who
knew would strengthen your

657
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,280
investment thesis to really
help it take off because it

658
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,200
seems like every start up is
faced with that.

659
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,190
>> Yep.
>> That same challenge.

660
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,900
>> So one of the really
fundamental things is to,

661
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,290
is to think about product
distribution as key.

662
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,990
And for LinkedIn, we had a
couple things going for us.

663
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,790
So one, the web was boring in
2003.

664
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,660
That basically what happened
is everyone had

665
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,010
thought the consumer net was
over.

666
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,650
And so people were doing clean
tag and

667
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,060
enterprise software and
everything else.

668
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,650
It's a much harder problem
now.

669
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,900
because everyone thinks the
Internet and

670
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,620
mobile is interesting.

671
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,090
And so breaking through the
noise is really key.

672
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,920
So the strategy we use
wouldn't work.

673
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,940
We just set up,

674
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,575
sent out some invitations to a
group of people and then

675
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,560
tuned the mechanism to have,
and did PR to get people.

676
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,640
Like one of the decisions we
made early that was right was

677
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,090
to say should we only allow it
as invite only?

678
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,290
Or should we allow cold sign
ups?

679
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,760
The reason we should allow
cold sign ups is

680
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,240
because the people who are
super enthusiastic about this

681
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,530
weren't necessarily the people
you know,

682
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,460
so they would sign up and
spread it.

683
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,480
That sort of thing were all
the kind of decisions we made.

684
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,360
Now that challenge is much
harder because the challenge

685
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,765
when you think about product
distribution is,

686
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:28,170
it's how are you competing for
potential customers' or

687
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,510
potential members time and
what do they think,

688
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,480
what do they have to believe
in.

689
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,910
Back in 2003 it was like
well,a professional network.

690
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,010
That's potentially a good
idea, what the hell.

691
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,670
I'll play with that.

692
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,880
There's not a lot of other
things for me to look at.

693
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,630
Today, there's tons of things
and so your strategy today,

694
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,960
when you're looking at product
distribution,

695
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,620
has to be, what is my really
decisive edge?

696
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,890
What is the hack that I know
that other people don't know?

697
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,859
>> Someone come to you,

698
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:01,393
how do you tell
>> So

699
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:04,683
how do I know someone's a good
founder or not?

700
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:08,550
well, it's not I'm a huge
believer in references.

701
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,855
Usually I only ever, actually
no.

702
00:29:12,855 --> 00:29:16,270
100% of the time in this case,
I only meet with someone when

703
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,460
they come to me through a
reference.

704
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,920
So one of the things, by the
way is,

705
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,070
the thing is I, after this I
have to run off because I

706
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,700
have a meeting I need to get
to.

707
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,215
If you want to actually get
time and

708
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,790
attention Lee, find a
reference.

709
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,640
It's not a pitch to using
LinkedIn, it's a question of,

710
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,290
this is how you sort out time.

711
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,210
You can find out, like Sam
knows me.

712
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,520
Lift up, throw Sam under the
bus.

713
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,090
Right?

714
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,590
Yes.

715
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,920
And so a reference to me is in
fact the way that I do this.

716
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,630
And so for example, when I met
with the AirBnB guys.

717
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,650
Part of the reason why I

718
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,070
could interrupt them two
minutes into their pitch, and

719
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,940
say, I'm going to make you an
offer to invest.

720
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,114
I want to hear the rest of the
pitch,

721
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,460
because I think what you're
doing here is,

722
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,850
is, is magical and awesome.

723
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,055
Was because I'd already had
references on them.

724
00:29:58,055 --> 00:29:58,870
Like that was only two
minutes,

725
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,800
not even thirty minutes.

726
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,780
Because I already knew about
them before coming in.

727
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,910
And by the way, by and large
that's some version of

728
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,960
that is true of most of the
great industries.

729
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,550
And it's that, it's that
network that's really key.
