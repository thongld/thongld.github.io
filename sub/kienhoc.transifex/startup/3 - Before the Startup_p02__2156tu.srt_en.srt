298
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,340
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ
There's only users.

299
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,870
And all users care about is
whether your software.

300
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,390
Does what they want, right?

301
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,610
They're like sharks.

302
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,180
Sharks are, like, too stupid
to fool.

303
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,330
You can't, like, wave a red
flag at a shark and fool it,

304
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,507
it's like, meat or no meat.

305
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,955
So, you have to have
something people want.

306
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:48,795
And you only prosper to the
extend that you do.

307
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,181
The dangerous thing is,

308
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:53,019
particularly for you guys,
the dangerous thing is

309
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,570
that faking does work to
some extent with investors.

310
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,600
You, if you're really good
at

311
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,280
knowing what you're talking
about.

312
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,870
You can fool investors for

313
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,920
one, maybe two rounds of
funding.

314
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,630
But it's not in your
interest to.

315
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,740
I mean, you're all doing
this for equity.

316
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,090
You're playing a confidence
trick on yourself.

317
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,280
You're wasting your own
time,

318
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,920
because the startup is
doomed.

319
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,030
And all you're doing is,

320
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,680
you're just gonna waste your
time writing it down.

321
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,860
So, stop looking for the
trick.

322
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,820
There are tricks in the
startups,

323
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,300
as there are in any domain.

324
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,060
But they are an order of
magnitude less

325
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,360
important than solving the
real problem.

326
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,120
Someone who knows zero about
fund raising but

327
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,800
has made something users
really love will have

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,570
an easier time raising
money.

329
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,440
Than someone who knows every
trick in the book, but

330
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,190
has a flat usage graph.

331
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,240
Though in a sense it's bad
news that

332
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,980
gaming the startups stops
works gaming the system,

333
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,170
stops working now.

334
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,960
In a sense that you're
deprived of one of your most

335
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,130
powerful weapons and

336
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,360
afterall something you have
spent 20 years mastering.

337
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,920
It is something, I find it
very exciting.

338
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,750
That there even exists parts
of the world

339
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,140
where gaming the system is
not how you win.

340
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,020
I would have been really
excited in college if I had

341
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,210
explicitly realized that
there were parts of

342
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,760
the world where

343
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,850
gaming the system matters
less than others.

344
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,940
And some where it hardly
matters at all.

345
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,930
But there are, and this is
one of the most important

346
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,220
things to think about when
you're planning your future.

347
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,799
Got that, okay.

348
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,857
How do you win at each type
of the work?

349
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:28,199
And what do you want to win
by doing?

350
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,892
So, that brings us to

351
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,130
our fourth counterintuitive
point.

352
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,470
Startups are all consuming.

353
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,620
If you start a start up, it
will take over your life

354
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,600
to a degree that you cannot
imagine.

355
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,499
And if it succeeds, it will
take over your life for

356
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:46,196
a long time.

357
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:48,025
For several years, at the
very least.

358
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,680
Maybe a decade.

359
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,370
Maybe the rest of your
working life.

360
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,108
So there's a real
opportunity cost here,

361
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:57,111
it may seem to you that
Larry Page has an enviable

362
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:57,711
life, but

363
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,808
there are parts of it that
are definitely unenviable.

364
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:02,576
The way the world looks to
him,

365
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:05,228
is that he started running
as fast as he could at

366
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:05,981
age 25.

367
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:09,165
And he has not stopped to
catch his breath since.

368
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:12,344
Every day, shit happens
within the Google empire

369
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,280
that only the emperor can
deal with.

370
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,538
And he, as the emperor, has
to deal with it.

371
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,680
If he goes on vacation for

372
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,470
even a week, a whole backlog
of shit accumulates.

373
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,920
And he has to bear this
uncomplainingly, because,

374
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,710
number one, as the company's
daddy,

375
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,940
he can never show fear or
weakness.

376
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,080
And number two, if you're a
billionaire,

377
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,480
you get zero, actually less
than zero sympathy if you

378
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,420
complain about having a
difficult life.

379
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,370
Which has this strange side
effect

380
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,800
that the difficulty of being
a successful startup founder

381
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,320
is concealed from almost
everyone who's done it.

382
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,240
People who win the hundred
meters in the Olympics,

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,180
like they walk up to them
and

384
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,580
they're going like, right.

385
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,980
Larry Page is doing that
too, but

386
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,850
you never get to see it.

387
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,850
All right, where are we?

388
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,150
Y Combinator has now funded
several companies that

389
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,280
could be called big
successes.

390
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,800
And in every single case,

391
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,490
the founders say the same
thing,

392
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,280
it never gets any easier.

393
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,010
The nature of the problems
change.

394
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,230
So, you may be worrying
about more

395
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,890
glamorous problems like
construction delays in

396
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,950
your new London offices,
rather than the broken air

397
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,800
conditioner in your studio
apartment.

398
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,860
But the total volume of
worry never decreases,

399
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,940
if anything, it increases.

400
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,130
Starting a successful
startup is similar to

401
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,600
having kids, in that it's
like a button you press,

402
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,230
that changes your life
irrevocably.

403
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,100
And while it is, like,

404
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,700
honestly the best thing in
the world having kids.

405
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,178
If you take away one thing
from this lecture,

406
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,316
remember that.

407
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,916
>> There are a lot of things
that are easier to do

408
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,155
after you, before you have
kids, then after.

409
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,126
Many of which will make you
a better parent,

410
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:58,150
when you do have kids.

411
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,590
And so, in rich countries,

412
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,770
most people delay pushing
the button for a while.

413
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,430
And I'm sure you

414
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,070
are all intimately familiar
with that procedure.

415
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,590
Yet, when it comes to
starting startups,

416
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,460
a lot of people seem to
think they're supposed to

417
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,770
start them in college.

418
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,180
Are you crazy?

419
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,090
And what are the
universities thinking?

420
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,180
They go out of their way to
ensure that their

421
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,810
students are well supplied
with contraceptives.

422
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,680
And yet they're starting up
entrepreneurship programs

423
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,499
and startup incubators left
and right.

424
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,810
>> To be fair,

425
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,020
the universities have their
hand forced here.

426
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,140
A lot of incoming students
are interested in startups.

427
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,100
Universities are at least
defacto,

428
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,780
supposed to prepare you for
your career.

429
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,990
And so, if you're interested
in startups, it seems like

430
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,100
universities are supposed to
teach you about startups.

431
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,420
And if they don't,

432
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,200
maybe they loose applicants
to universities.

433
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,780
You do claim to do that.

434
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,220
So, can universities teach
you about startups?

435
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,960
Well, if not what are we
doing here?

436
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:00,228
>> Yes and no, as I explain,
they can teach you about

437
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:03,520
startups, but this is not
what you need to know.

438
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,810
Essentially, what universe,
if you wanna learn French,

439
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,090
universities can teach you
linguistics.

440
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,870
That's what this is.

441
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,430
This is a linguistics class.

442
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,370
Right?
We're teaching you

443
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,770
about how to learn
languages.

444
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,950
And what you need to know is
like,

445
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,590
how to learn a particular
language?

446
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,470
What you need to know, are
the needs of your own users.

447
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,580
You can't learn those,

448
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,010
until you actually start the
company.

449
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,970
And starting a company,

450
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,870
which means that starting a
startup is something, and

451
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,610
you can intrinsically only
learn by doing it.

452
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,390
And you can't do that in
college for

453
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,610
the reason I just explained,

454
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,370
that startups take over your
entire life.

455
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,850
If you start a startup in
college,

456
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,450
If you start up a startup as
a student,

457
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,150
you can't start up a startup
as a student, because if

458
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,780
you start a startup you're
not a student anymore.

459
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,210
You may be nominally a
student, but

460
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,190
you won't even be that for
much longer.

461
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,120
So, given this dichotomy,

462
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,290
which of the two paths
should you take?

463
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,624
Be a real student and not
start a startup or

464
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,975
start a real startup and not
be a student.

465
00:18:56,975 --> 00:18:58,835
Well I can answer that one
for you.

466
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:02,058
I'm talking to my own kids
here.

467
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,610
Do not start a startup in
college.

468
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,042
I hope I'm not disappointing
anyone, seriously, honestly.

469
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:12,260
Starting a startup could be
a component of

470
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,000
a good life for

471
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,960
a lot of ambitious people,
but this is just part of

472
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,510
a much bigger problem that
your trying to solve.

473
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,640
How to have a good life,
right, and

474
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,330
though starting a startup
could be a good thing to

475
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,750
do at some point, 20 is not
the optimal time to do it.

476
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,190
There are things, that, that
you can’t, there are things

477
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,910
you can do in your early
20’s, that you cannot do as

478
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,290
well before or after, like
plunge deeply into

479
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,760
projects on a whim that seem
like they have no payoff.

480
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,670
Or travel super cheaply with
no sense of a deadline.

481
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,090
In fact those are really
just isomorphic shapes in

482
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,280
different domains.

483
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,460
For unambitious people this
sort of thing can

484
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,070
be the dreaded failure to
launch.

485
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,760
But for the ambitious ones,

486
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,630
it's a really valuable sort
of exploration.

487
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,910
And if you start a startup
at 20,

488
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,270
and you're sufficiently
successful,

489
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,240
you will never get to do it.

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,100
Mark Zuckerberg will never
get to

491
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,530
bum around a foreign
country.

492
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,160
He can, if he goes to a
foreign country,

493
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,180
it's either as a defacto
state visit, or, like,

494
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,910
he's hiding out incognito at
the George Cinc in Paris.

495
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,560
Right?

496
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,230
But he's never gonna get to
just, like,

497
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,050
backpack around Thailand if
that's still what people do.

498
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,450
Do people still backpack
around Thailand?

499
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,320
>> Yes.
>> Okay, well there,

500
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,970
that's the first real sign
of enthusiasm I've seen from

501
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,122
this audience.

502
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:33,970
I should have given this
talk in Thailand.

503
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,160
>> All right, he can do
things that you can't do,

504
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,940
like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries,

505
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,650
really big jets.

506
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,260
But success has taken a lot
of

507
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,830
the serendipity out of his
life.

508
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,130
Facebook is running him as
much as he

509
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,250
is running Facebook.

510
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,590
And while it can be really
cool to be in the grip of

511
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,790
some project you consider
your life's work,

512
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,970
there are advantages to
serendipity.

513
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,350
And among other things, it
gives you more options to

514
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,530
choose your life's work
from.

515
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,040
There's not even a trade-off
here.

516
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,830
You're not sacrificing
anything if

517
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,930
you forego starting a
startup at 20,

518
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,700
cuz you'll be more likely to
succeed if you wait.

519
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,961
In the unlikely case that
you're 20,

520
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:24,486
like astronomically unlikely
case, that you're 20 and you

521
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:27,694
have some side project that
takes off like Facebook did.

522
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:30,122
Then you face the choice of
either running with it or

523
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,130
not, and maybe it's
reasonable to run with it.

524
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,720
But usually the way startups
take off is for

525
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,270
the founders to make them
take off.

526
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,098
It's gratuitously stupid to
do that at 20.

527
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:44,499
So should you do it at any
age?

528
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:47,536
I realize, I've made
Starting a startup sound

529
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:48,910
kind of hard.

530
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,420
If I haven't, let me try
again.

531
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,570
Starting a startup is really
hard.

532
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,310
What if it's too hard?

533
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,460
What if you're not up to
this challenge?

534
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,390
The answer is the fifth
counter-intuitive point.

535
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,260
You can't tell.

536
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,900
Your life, so far,

537
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,730
has given you some idea what
your prospects might be,

538
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,330
if you wanted to become a
mathematician, or

539
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,760
a professional football
player.

540
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,940
Boy, it's not every audience
you could say that to.

541
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,590
But unless you have had a
very strange life,

542
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,100
indeed, you

543
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,020
have not done much that's
like starting a startup.

544
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,640
Meaning, starting a startup
will change you a lot

545
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,850
if it works out.

546
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,970
So, what you're trying to
estimate is not just what

547
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,160
you are, but what you could
become, and who can do that?

548
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,850
Well, not me, for the last
nine years,

549
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,982
it was my job to try and
guess whether people would.

550
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,113
Guess is, I wrote predicted
here and

551
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:43,080
it came out as guess.

552
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,300
That's a very informative
Freudian slip.

553
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,720
>> Seriously, it's easy to
tell how smart people are in

554
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,260
ten minutes.

555
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,080
You know, hit a few tennis
balls over the net and

556
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,450
do they hit them back at you
or into the net.

557
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,630
But, the hard part was, and
the most important part was

558
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,930
predicting how tough and
ambitious they would become.

559
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,680
There may be no one at this
point who

560
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,490
has more experience than me
at doing this.

561
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,210
And I can tell you

562
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,988
how much an expert can know
about that.

563
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,310
The answer is, not much.

564
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,170
I learned from experience to
keep a completely open

565
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,440
mind about which startup in
each batch,

566
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,290
which startups would turn
out to be the stars.

567
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,500
The founders sometimes
thought they knew.

568
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,970
Some arrived feeling
confident that they

569
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,720
would ace Y Combinator,

570
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,930
just as they had aced every
one of the few, easy,

571
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,160
artificial tests they had
faced in life so far.

572
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,960
Others arrived wondering
what mistake could cause

573
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,840
them to be admitted and

574
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,340
hoping that no one would
discover it.

575
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,810
But there's little to no
correlation between these

576
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,309
attitudes in how things turn
out.

577
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,082
I've read the same is true
in the military that

578
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:53,198
the swaggering recruits are
no more likely to

579
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,436
turn out to be really tough
than the quiet ones.

580
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:58,354
And probably for the same
reason that the tests are so

581
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,480
different from the tests in
people's previous lives.

582
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,940
If you're absolutely
terrified of

583
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,490
starting a startup, you
probably shouldn't do it,

584
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,470
unless you're one of those
people who

585
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,090
gets off on doing things
you're afraid of.

586
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,370
Otherwise, if you're merely
unsure of

587
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,310
whether you're gonna be able
to do it,

588
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,420
the only way to find out is
to try, just not now.

589
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,468
So, if you wanna startup one
day, if you wanna start

590
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:28,170
a startup one day, what do
you do now in college?

591
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,966
There are only two things
you need initially,

592
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:34,580
an idea, and co-founders.

593
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,940
And the MO for getting them
both is the same,

594
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,260
which leads to our sixth,
sixth and
