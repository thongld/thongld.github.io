1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,280
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVhTvQXfibU
So when Sam originally sent me
an email to do this course,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,400
he said Ben can you teach a 15
minute course on management.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,980
And I immediately thought to
myself, wow,

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,220
I just wrote a 300 page book
on management, so

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,120
that book was entirely too
long.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,800
And I, I didn't actually have
time to collapse the 300 pages

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,390
into 50 minutes.

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,540
So like Mark Twain, I didn't
have time to write

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,240
a good short letter, so I'm
going to write a long letter.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,560
But in this case,

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,900
I'm going to teach exactly one
management concept.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,360
So, one long thing.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,610
And this management concept
though,

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,000
is the thing that I see CEOs
mess up more consistently than

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,560
anything else, and from when
they're very,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,740
very early to when they're
very, very big as a company.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,620
It's the easiest thing to say,
and

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,810
the most difficult to master.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,774
And, the concept in musical
form, whoops, pardon me,

20
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,210
very sensitive.

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,100
But musical form.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:12,070
This is from Sly And The
Family Stone.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,400
Sometimes I'm right.

24
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:18,761
>> So.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,597
No difference what group I'm
in.

26
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,310
So that's, that's the musical
version of today's lesson.

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,300
For those of you, you are
musical, you can leave now.

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,210
In management concept form,
basically it's this.

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,680
When you're making a critical
decision,

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,600
you have to understand how
it's going to be interpreted

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,670
from all points of view, not
just your point of view and

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,600
not just the person you're
talking to, but

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
to people who aren't in the
room, everybody else.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,700
In other words, you really
have to be able, when

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,600
making critical decisions, to
see the decision.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,740
Through the eyes of the
company, and the company as

37
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,290
a whole, which means you've
got to kind of add up

38
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,530
every employee's view, and

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,720
then incorporate that into
your own view, otherwise your

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,580
management decisions are going
to have have very weird,

41
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,620
side effects and,

42
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,230
and potentially very dangerous
consequences.

43
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,390
And it's a really hard thing
to do,

44
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,070
because at the point when
you're making

45
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,960
a decision you're often under
a great deal of pressure.

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,070
So let's get into the agenda.

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,830
So I'm going to cover a kind
of four cases,

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,130
first I'm going to cover
demotions,

49
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,260
which is a very emotional
thing.

50
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,680
Then raises, which is also an
emotional thing.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,390
Then we're going to evaluate
one of Sams blog posts.

52
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,370
Which is news to Sam, so I'd
figure out I'd tease him

53
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,110
since he invited me to a do a
50 minute management class,

54
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,340
after I wrote a 300 page book.

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,460
And then I'm going to talk
about,

56
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,520
history's greatest
practitioner at this, and

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm wearing a shirt with him
on it, and kind of how he used

58
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,190
it to do something he has
done, had ever done before in

59
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,210
human history and has never
done since in human history.

60
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,630
But basically complete
mastery, of,

61
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,000
of the technique I'm going to
talk about.

62
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,830
So, first business example.

63
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,540
You've got an executive, and
do you demote, or

64
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,660
do you fire him?

65
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,900
And this comes from an actual
conversation, an actual real

66
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,340
life situation that I was
working on with a CEO.

67
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,619
And so, the basic situation
was this.

68
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,340
He had a great executive, or
like an executive who,

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,320
just a great effort.

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,470
Like, he hired him.

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,530
He was working harder than
anybody else in the company,

72
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,580
doing you know, like,
everything he was supposed to.

73
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,470
Everybody liked him, because
he worked so hard, and

74
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,070
like was a general smart
person.

75
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,450
But he was just in over his
head knowledge wise.

76
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,680
He did not have the knowledge
and the skills to basically do

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
what the company needed him to
do or,

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,580
like, really compete against
the competition, so

79
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,040
he couldn't actually keep him
in the job.

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,110
But he's a great guy.

81
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,910
And you know, so the question
is, well.

82
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,810
Should I fire this person?

83
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,670
Or can I just move him into a
lower role and

84
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,160
bring in a person above him.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,640
And then, like, you know, that
would be real cool.

86
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,720
So, let's look at how you
kind of make that decision.

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,310
So you in this, in this case
this was the CEO, so

88
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,080
you as a CEO.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,760
So, one like, look, it's
really hard if somebody comes

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,930
to work everyday like at, you
know, 6 a.m.,

91
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,446
and is like working till 10
p.m.

92
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,980
And like doing it,

93
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,370
like, harder than anybody in
the company.

94
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,590
It's really hard to just say,
well, sorry, like,

95
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,670
nice effort, but you don't get
an A for an effort.

96
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,140
You get an F because I fired
you.

97
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,860
>>
>> Nobody nobody wants to

98
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,740
have that conversation.

99
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:52,660
>>
>> And then, a demotion is

100
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,750
kind of neat because from the
CEO's point of view, and this

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,730
is, he's like, Look, like, we
can keep him in the company.

102
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,590
He works so hard.

103
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,620
He's a good example of

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,920
somebody who gives a great
effort.

105
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,970
And you know, like, and then
he's got a lot of

106
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,730
friends in the company, and
they're, you know,

107
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,980
from a cultural standpoint
like, it's a, it's a win,

108
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,838
win because like, he gets to
stay and, and, you know,

109
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:13,500
like and then I can bring in
somebody that can solve my

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,240
problem, but I, I don't have
to create another problem.

111
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,280
And then if you think about it

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,180
from the executive's
perspective,.

113
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,390
And what they would think,
it's like, well, I,

114
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,000
you know, I don't want to be
demoted.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,490
But I really don't want to be
fired,

116
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,850
because if I get fired that's
a way harder more complicated

117
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,290
thing to explain to my next
employer than I got demoted.

118
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,510
Like, getting demoted is like,

119
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,280
well, I didn't really get
demoted, I got a new job.

120
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,619
>> A smaller title.

121
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:44,329
And then, you know, the, the,
the last thing is it enables,

122
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:47,829
you know, like theoretically,
while, like, you know,

123
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,990
the company, you know, we
value all our employees.

124
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,770
We brought you in.

125
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,700
We made a commitment to you as
an employee.

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,980
And, like, we value everybody.

127
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,530
And it kind of

128
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,210
will enable you to keep
growing with the company.

129
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,680
And so.

130
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,790
You know and this was the kind
of initial conversation I

131
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,850
had with a CEO and, and

132
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,430
I said well wait a minute, I
said, let me ask you this.

133
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,800
Like what is the,

134
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,350
what's the equity package that
this exec has?

135
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,650
And he goes well what do you
mean?

136
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,200
And I was like,

137
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,480
well like does he have like,
director level compensation,

138
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,070
does he got like a vice
president level compensation?

139
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,020
Does he have a point and a
half?

140
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,220
Does he have 0.4% or what?

141
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,640
and, you know?

142
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,860
That kind of gave the CEO
pause.

143
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,200
He's, like, well, he does have
a point and a half.

144
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,770
And I was, like, okay.

145
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,490
So you're an engineer in your
company.

146
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,280
How do you feel about somebody
who used to be the head of

147
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,680
sales, who got brought in with
a point and a half.

148
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,790
Now, mind you, you're an
engin-,

149
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,950
what do your engineers get?

150
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,572
Like, they get.

151
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:46,510
.1%, .2%, what are they
getting at this point?

152
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,200
So how are they going to feel
about somebody who's

153
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,340
not the head of sales with
1.5% of the company.

154
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,490
And he was like oh.

155
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,890
And I was like, yeah, oh.

156
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,369
Because like how fair is that?

157
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,590
So are you going to take the
equity away, are you up for

158
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,180
doing that, are you up for
going back and

159
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,300
taking back his compensation?

160
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,410
And like how productive do

161
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,710
you think he'll be if you take
away his compensation?

162
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,620
And then secondly, like Will
people give him

163
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,051
the same respect now that
you've demoted him,

164
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:23,767
because they knew him as this,
and now he's this.

165
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,121
And so like, I knew you when
you were head of sales,

166
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,695
now you're the regional
manager, and

167
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,349
you're telling me what the to
do?

168
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,650
You're telling me I need to
make that call?

169
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,310
Like, seems to me you got
demoted.

170
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,070
You know, who are you to talk
to me?

171
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm an up and comer.

172
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,930
I'll be the next VP of sales
at the next company.

173
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,530
So all these things come into
play.

174
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,580
And so when you look out at
the end,

175
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,780
like you may think you're
dealing with one person.

176
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,510
You may think that this is a
demotion, or a firing of one

177
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,720
person, and what does it mean
according to that one person.

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,980
But what you're really doing
is you're saying look.

179
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,660
What does it mean to fail on
the job?

180
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,800
Particularly, a very,

181
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,130
the highest paid, highest
compensated job

182
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,550
in the company from an equity
standpoint, and then,

183
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,200
like, what's required to
maintain your equity?

184
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,660
Like is it good enough to put
in an effort?

185
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,650
Or do you have to get a
result.

186
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,420
And in different situations at
different levels, look,

187
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,340
these answers will come out
differently.

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,800
And if this had been a person
not that

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,690
was an executive brought in
from the outside but

190
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,670
was somebody who you maybe
promoted past where they

191
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,400
should have been, and didn't
ever get that equity, like,

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,140
maybe you make a different
decision.

193
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,550
But you've gotta understand
what it's going to mean to

194
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,080
everybody, not just the person
you're talking to.

195
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,680
Example two.

196
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,190
An excellent employee asks for
a raise.

197
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,600
Good employee.

198
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,750
This isn't like a, like the
last employee.

199
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,930
This is like really good
employee.

200
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,570
So excellent employee asks for
a raise.

201
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,490
So, look.

202
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,760
Your first thing is like,

203
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
they're really good, they
asked me for

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,910
a raise, they didn't ask me
for no reason.

205
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,320
They ask me because they think
they deserve it.

206
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,070
I want to retain them.

207
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,020
Like, I want to be fair.

208
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,980
They've done a great job.

209
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,430
I want to be fair, and, like,
you know,

210
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,900
I know that if I give them
this raise, like,

211
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,280
it's going to be all love
coming my way,.

212
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,945
That's going to be if I gave
you a raise, we're good,

213
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,470
you know, like we're boys.

214
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,320
>> Look at you.

215
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,849
You got a raise.

216
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,650
>> It's awesome.

217
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,870
So like, you know from your
perspective you know what you

218
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,200
want to do when somebody asks
you for a raise.

219
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,880
And then if you look at it,
okay, so

220
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,470
what about from their
perspective, what,

221
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,850
how would they, like, take it
if you gave them the raise.

222
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,020
And now you have to remember
the employee from, for

223
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,400
them to get to the point where
they've asked you for a raise.

224
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,620
This is not something they
just like woke up one

225
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,940
morning and like, I'm going in
and asking for a raise, right?

226
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,363
Like this is something where
they've thought about it

227
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,996
a lot, they've you know,
compared their other options,

228
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,472
they may have an offer from
another company, you know,

229
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,895
they're, it's something their
spouse probably has

230
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,181
been talking to them about.

231
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,470
And so it's a serious thing.

232
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,530
And so, if you give it to
them,

233
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,370
they're very likely to feel
very good about it.

234
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,770
Like, they may be like
paranoid,

235
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,200
about like why are you giving
me a raise?

236
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,141
But, very unlikely.

237
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,491
Much more and they'll feel
like.

238
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,187
I'm sorry, I have to just let
the whole thing play.

239
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,133
And that's, that's for

240
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,368
those of you who don't know,
that's Bobby Shmurda.

241
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:47,286
>>
>> And,

242
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:50,645
Rowdy Rebel doing the Shmoney
Dance.

243
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:51,265
>>
>> But that's,

244
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,612
that's likely the reaction
you'll get.

245
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,040
So there's a lot of momentum
to say yes, look,

246
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,199
they read Sheryll's book, they
leaned in and I'm going to

247
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,260
reward them for, for doing all
that, which is, you know?

248
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,360
And, and by the way, that book
has very good advice,

249
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,424
so I'm, I'm not knocking on
that.

250
00:11:06,424 --> 00:11:09,042
I don't want you to be
misinterpreting me.

251
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,970
however, you know, there was
going to be a however.

252
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,112
What about, you have to think
about it through the point of

253
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,946
view of the employee who did
not ask for the raise.

254
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:23,018
So the employee who didn't for
the raise, they may be doing

255
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:27,365
a better job than the employee
who did do, ask for the raise.

256
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:30,472
And in their mind they're
going, okay, so I didn't ask

257
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,448
for a raise and I didn't get a
raise, and they asked for

258
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:36,920
a raise and they got a raise,
and so what does that mean?

259
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,150
That means one, like you're
not

260
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,570
really evaluating people's
performance.

261
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,650
You're just going well whoever
asks, gets.

262
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,220
So that means like, I either
need to be that guy,

263
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,790
who asks for the raise.

264
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,868
Like and I, I, you know,

265
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,926
that's just no how I feel you
know, I do my work and

266
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,260
I don't necessarily want to
ask for a raise.

267
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,990
Or like I should, I just need
to quit and go to

268
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,240
a company that like actually
evaluates performance.

269
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,110
And then you know, so you
could really make the person

270
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,980
who doesn't get the raise feel
like, pretty pissy about it.

271
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,490
And don't think that when
somebody's walking down your

272
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,010
company doing the shmoney
dance that

273
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,220
other people aren't going to
notice, like.

274
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,300
So they're going to be fired
up about that raise.

275
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,600
They're saying, oh you can
say, oh this is

276
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,480
highly confidential that I'm
giving you this raise.

277
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,246
It's not confidential.

278
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,820
And then the cultural
conclusion is going to

279
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,740
be everybody in your company
is going to feel that

280
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,160
they now have a fiduciary
responsibility to their

281
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
family to ask for a raise all
of the time.

282
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,270
Because if they don't, then
they may be missing out on

283
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,780
a raise that they would have
otherwise gotten.

284
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,930
And like you talk to any
experienced CEO and

285
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,370
they will tell you this is
true.

286
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,030
Like if you give out raises
when people just ask you for

287
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,380
them, like that,

288
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,530
you will have a lot of people
asking you for raises.

289
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,110
That is called encouraging
behavior.

290
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,600
So what do you do?

291
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,970
And really, the right answer
on raises is you have

292
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,460
to be formal.

293
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,440
And you have to be formal to
save your own culture.

294
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
And I know this is always,

295
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,850
this is the thing that causes
people running startups, fits.
