491
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk
new information there.

492
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,020
Which is why it's important to
talk to different extremes of

493
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,680
people right.

494
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,550
Go, go find people who

495
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,850
are different different points
because this is just six or

496
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,610
seven Stanford college
students, you're going to get

497
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,850
a very different response when
we talk to six or

498
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,996
seven high school students, or
six or seven parents.

499
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:53,508
All right, one second, let me
look at the So

500
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:59,100
based on that though, right, I
think the.

501
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,990
I think it's possible you
could come up with,

502
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,370
a set of ideas, right?

503
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,400
You have this information
about how someone takes notes,

504
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,540
you've, you've come up with,

505
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,530
potentially when you came up
with this idea you had,

506
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,330
you had some ideas as to, you
heard this idea, you had

507
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,140
some ideas as to like how you
could build something cool.

508
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,510
And so, if you're going to
build

509
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,460
just one feature on top of
Google Docs.

510
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,630
What would that feature be,
right?

511
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,550
And that's for, for, for a new
product like this, it might be

512
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,950
a good way to like get started
thinking about where to go.

513
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,802
Which is,

514
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:33,520
okay, they're extensively
using this things, right now.

515
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,170
How can we make that

516
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,060
experience just one quantum
better?

517
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,530
Something that would be.

518
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,040
Really exciting to this person
to be one one step ahead, and

519
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,420
so let me take two minutes,
right now.

520
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,157
And think about, what that
feature might be?

521
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:50,780
Actually like try to, try to
come up with what,

522
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,024
what you might do based on
what you heard from,

523
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,817
from Stephanie, that could
convince her to

524
00:19:56,817 --> 00:20:00,895
switch away from her current
collaborative, multi-person,

525
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,239
all-working-together workflow
on Google Docs?

526
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,131
To your new, your new thing
that is,

527
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:08,573
has all the features of Google
Docs plus this one

528
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,150
special thing that's, like,
going to make it,.

529
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,433
It's going to make it more be,
more useful, and, and

530
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:16,351
convincing the stop using that
they are using.

531
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:05,965
Awesome, all right.

532
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,055
So, I'm going to invite our,
our third guest, if you,

533
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,650
if you have something up.

534
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,480
I, I don't want to put you on
the spot if

535
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,709
you feel like you don't,
you're not sure, but.

536
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,130
>> Yeah.
>> So what I, what I, is

537
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,700
it on?

538
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,390
>> Yes.

539
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:21,590
>> What I thought about was
like the, the reason she uses

540
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,770
Everknow is like, of like,
sticky note type notes like,

541
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,290
like more thoughts and like
details.

542
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,320
So, I feel like, Google Docs
has like documents and

543
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,300
not like, smaller notes.

544
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,740
So, I feel like a feature that
will be like,

545
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,740
super like, a mobile version
of draw it

546
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,620
that doesn't like, isn't that
clunky and like, doesn't make

547
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,810
you make real documents could
be like, really useful.

548
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,530
Awesome.

549
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,640
So right.
That's a,

550
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,460
that's a good insight.

551
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,590
Right, that's exactly,

552
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,810
what's one of the thing that
you get out of that,

553
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,370
that user interview?

554
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,760
And then, you've got this
idea.

555
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,380
Right, you've gotten this, I
guess, user-fed feedback.

556
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,570
You've got this idea.

557
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,130
What if we've had a Google
Docs that had

558
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,150
the collaborative aspects and
the group aspects of that, but

559
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,580
where you you could pull in
more little one off notes.

560
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,320
And, it was, it was designed
more around note taking.

561
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,270
And so, the question is, now,
once you have this idea,

562
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,470
which I think it's the,

563
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,560
it's actually probably a
reasonable approach.

564
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,790
Is this enough?

565
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,470
Is this something people would
actually switch just to have?

566
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,050
And, the way to validate,

567
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,010
there's two ways to validate
that.

568
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,700
One is if you're quick at
programming,

569
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,330
you can literally just go
build it, and

570
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,860
throw it out in the world and
see what happens.

571
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,660
and, that's that's great.

572
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,600
And, if that, when that works
that's

573
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
that's an excellent way to
approach it.

574
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,990
But, a lot of the time that
one little thing that's just

575
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,050
a little bit better might take
you three months to

576
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,170
actually build something
worthy of actually using.

577
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,060
And so, you actually want to
go out and

578
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,490
validate that idea further
before you go ahead and

579
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,720
start building it.

580
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,950
And so, you might take that
idea, and

581
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,370
you might go back go back out
and

582
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,200
you know, you can sit down
with with diagrams.

583
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,130
You can, you can draw what the
what it looks like.

584
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,700
Draw the work flow, and go
bring that in front of people,

585
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,540
but the one thing you really
don't want to do is

586
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,440
ask them this, this is sort of
a trap, and

587
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
I just want to warn you
against doing it.

588
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,140
Just don't go out and say, to
come up with a feature idea,

589
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,930
and go out and ask people.

590
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,400
Are, you know?
I've got this great idea

591
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,970
for a feature.

592
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,570
Are you excited about it?

593
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,330
Because, the, the feedback you
get from users, if you tell

594
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,520
them about a feature, and ask
them, is this feature good?

595
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,670
It's often, oh yeah, that's
great.

596
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,000
Like, that sounds like such a
good idea.

597
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,310
but, when you actually take
that in front of people, and

598
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,950
you actually build it.

599
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,090
You then, find out that while
they thought it

600
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,740
was such a clever idea, no one
actually, like,

601
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,200
cares to switch to get it.

602
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,150
And so, the one question you
can't ask is this feature

603
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,650
actually good or not?

604
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,230
Yes, Sam?
>> What is

605
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,820
the minimum that you

606
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,350
could do in your experience to
actually if asking, you know,

607
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,510
between asking and actually
building that whole thing.

608
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,630
>> Yeah.
So, Sam's asking if

609
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,670
what's the, what's the minimum
you can actually get away with

610
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,640
to validate, given that you
can't actually just go and

611
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,300
ask them is this good or not?

612
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,960
and, it's, it's highly
dependent the answer to

613
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,240
that is highly dependent on
the particular feature.

614
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,590
But, usually the, the best
thing you can do is, is, is,

615
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,650
really just hack something
together, right?

616
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,220
It's, you find, if your, if
your idea is to build

617
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,120
something on top of Google
Docs, don't, for your V1,

618
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,670
go rebuild, an awesome Google
Documents, but

619
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,850
for note taking application.

620
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,780
Find a way to write a browser
extension, that, that,

621
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,910
that stuffs just that little
bit of incremental feature in,

622
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,870
and, and see if it's actually
useful for people.

623
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,610
go, like actually, go,

624
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,940
go find a way to cheat is what
it comes down to,

625
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,740
because if you can't actually
put it in front of people

626
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,280
it's really, really hard to to
find that out.

627
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,360
For bigger things, where
you're actually trying to,

628
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,670
get people to spend money, it
actually gets a lot easier.

629
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,090
So, if you're selling it it's
great actually sales is

630
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,910
this cure all for this
problem.

631
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,390
Get people to put, give you
their credit card and

632
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,650
I guarantee you they're
actually using the feature.

633
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,780
It's it's one of the most
validating thing you

634
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,120
can do for a product, is go
out there and

635
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,780
actually get them to commit to
pay you up fron.

636
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,350
And, the problem is when
you're working on

637
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,780
a student note taking app,
that's going to be

638
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,610
relatively hard because you
probably unless your idea is

639
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,120
that you're actually going to
sell it.

640
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,100
It's probably something where
you're thinking at least the,

641
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,840
if the trial version's free,
and you're not necessarily

642
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,810
going to learn that much by
trying to charge people money.

643
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,220
But, if you go out there and

644
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,710
you can, if you can get people
to say hey I'm going to,

645
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,890
I'm going to give you money?

646
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,860
The money test is amazing, it
really does clarify whether or

647
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,410
not, they're rereally excited,

648
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,390
because if you're not
five-dollars-excited about it,

649
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,690
you're probably not very
excited about it.

650
00:25:32,738 --> 00:25:36,083
so, the last thing I wanted to
do was actually work

651
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:40,010
through with you guys, what
happened at Twitch.

652
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,640
So I brought some slides of
feedback that I would like to

653
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,172
get put up.

654
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:45,400
It's my, my only slides for

655
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,880
the for the thing and it's,
it's.

656
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,980
What it is it's,

657
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,530
it's, it's representative
excerpts of Twitch feedback.

658
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,630
I had a whole like,

659
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,260
26 page document full of all
the feedback.

660
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,240
And then, I realized that

661
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,850
reading that was going to be a
little bit tedious and

662
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,540
there was no way I'd make it
through it in a lecture.

663
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,409
So, pretend that like this is
stuff is all representative of

664
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,440
like, lots of people sent this
kind of thing out to,

665
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,700
to ask for me ask them
questions.

666
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,910
And, I've already pre
condensed it for

667
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,310
you in to the real feedback
you got.

668
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,570
So, when we were working on
Twitch to go launch it,

669
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,300
we we wouldn't talk too

670
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,370
much about existing Justin.tv
Broadcasters and asked them.

671
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,460
About their experience
broadcasting,

672
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,130
what they liked about
broadcasting,

673
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,120
why they broadcasted, what
they broadcasted,

674
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,020
what else was going on in
their life.

675
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,710
And, the interesting thing is
when you talk to users of

676
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,570
your product who are,

677
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,590
who are detailed users of your
product, they come back to

678
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,190
you with actually very detail
things about features.

679
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,820
Because they actually get
mired in the feature and

680
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,050
you have to sort of read
between the lines.

681
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,960
But they asked for first
things like I want to be

682
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,810
able to, way to clear the
banlist in my chat room.

683
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,100
Like, this, that was actually
a very

684
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,880
common request because there
was

685
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,730
a particular issue with how
our chat rooms worked.

686
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,210
People had asked for the
ability to edit the titles of

687
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,050
highlights after creating
them.

688
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,880
And, and it's,

689
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,940
it's, the, this was like, this
stuff was really consistent.

690
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,900
As we talked to broadcasters,

691
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,430
you probably talked to 12 fif,
fo, 14, something like that

692
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,260
broadcasters from the
Justin.tv gaming platform.

693
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,940
We got, we got all this
feedback and,

694
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,980
you know, what else do we
have?

695
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,170
We have your, your competitors
have all these cool features

696
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,950
like polls and scrolling text,
you, I can personalize chat

697
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,890
there and so, we have some
positive feedback.

698
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,346
They're like, oh, you guys
don't have ads, that's great.

699
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,980
I need to be able to ban.

700
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,280
So, a bunch of stuff around
chat.

701
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,180
A bunch of stuff around
interactivity with,

702
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,920
with interactivity with the
with their viewers.

703
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,310
And, that was all really
interesting.

704
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,940
So, this was what the, this is
what the Justin TV

705
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,270
broadcasters wanted us to
build.

706
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,640
And, this is what they, what,

707
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,310
what, where they felt pain
using the, using the product.

708
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,860
And so, if you thought that
what we

709
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,800
did was going to address these
problems, you would be wrong.

710
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,140
Because, actually, people who
are using your service already

711
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,720
and are willing to put up with
all these issues, kind of,

712
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,250
kind of means that

713
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,980
these are probably not
actually the biggest problems.

714
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,780
Because if you're willing to
ignore the fact that you can't

715
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,870
edit the band lesson, titles
are uneditable, and

716
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,490
there's no way to get trolls
out of your channel.

717
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,000
And, you're using the service
anyways,

718
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,280
maybe those aren't huge
problems.

719
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,240
And so, that sort of

720
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,370
brings up another really
important point.

721
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,200
Which is, you have to compare
you have to

722
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,070
compare groups of people, and

723
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,020
compare the level at which
they they argued with us.

724
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,565
So, if you go to the next
slide yes.

725
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,700
Nice.

726
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,150
We got competitor broadcaster
feedback,

727
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,300
which is really interesting.

728
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,680
So, this is stuff that you've,
we heard a lot from people who

729
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,110
are using other broadcast
platforms.

730
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,460
They wanted to be able to
switch multiple people onto

731
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,500
their channel at the same
time.

732
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,400
they, they complained about us
not

733
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,900
having a rev share program or
they talked a lot

734
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
about how they're trying to
make a living.

735
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,140
They really wanted to make
money pursuing this
