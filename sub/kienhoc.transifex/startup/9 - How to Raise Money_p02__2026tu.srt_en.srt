268
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFX95HahaUs
As compared to recruiting,
right?

269
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,540
As compared to recruiting
engineers.

270
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,900
In particular as compared to

271
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,050
recruiting engineer number
20.

272
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,725
It's far harder than raising
venture capital.

273
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,300
Selling to enterprise
customers is harder.

274
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,180
Getting viral growth going
on a consumer business is

275
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,970
harder, getting advertising
revenue is harder,

276
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,520
almost everything you'll
ever do is

277
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,880
harder than raising venture
capital.

278
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,460
And so, I think Parker is
exactly right.

279
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,061
If you get in a situation in
which raising the money is

280
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,488
hard, it's probably not hard
compared to

281
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:04,760
all the other stuff that's
about to follow.

282
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,720
And it's very important to
bear that in mind.

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,230
You know, it's often said
that raising money is not

284
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,670
actually a success, it's not
actually a milestone.

285
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,880
For a company and I think
that's true and

286
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,330
I think that's the
underlying reason.

287
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,280
It just, it puts you in a
position to be able to do

288
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,350
all the other, harder
things.

289
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,647
>> Related to that, what do
you guys wish foundry's did

290
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:25,460
differently, when raising
the money and.

291
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,039
You know, you mentioned this
relationship between money

292
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,401
and and how that applies
here so

293
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,333
maybe we could start with
that.

294
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,295
>> Yeah, so the single
biggest thing that people

295
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:36,060
are just missingand I think
it's all of our faults.

296
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,880
We're all not talking about
it enough but I think

297
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,050
the single biggest thing
entrepreneurs are missing

298
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,000
both on fundraising and how
they run their companies is

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,880
the relationship between
risk and cash.

300
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,980
So the relationship between
risk and raising cash and

301
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,870
then the relationship with
risk and spending cash.

302
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,690
So I've always been a fan of
something that Andy

303
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,930
Radcliffe taught me years
ago which he called the,

304
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,540
it's called the Onion Theory
of Risk which basically is

305
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,820
you can think about a
startup like on day one

306
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,740
as having every conceivable
kind of risk right?

307
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,830
And you can basically just
make a list of the risks.

308
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,670
So you've got, you know,

309
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,360
founding team risk, you
know, do the founders,

310
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,860
are the founders gonna be
able to work together?

311
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,740
Do you have the right
founders?

312
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,160
You're gonna have product
risk, you know,

313
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,340
can you build a product?

314
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,510
You'll have technical risk,
right?

315
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,630
Which is maybe you need a
machine

316
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,220
learning breakthrough or
something to make it work.

317
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,110
How are you going to be able
to do that?

318
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,930
You'll have you know, launch
risk.

319
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,720
Will the launch go well?

320
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,050
You'll have, you know,
market acceptance risk.

321
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,420
You'll have revenue risk.

322
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,830
A big risk you get into in a
lot of businesses that have

323
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,290
a sales force is can you
actually sell the product

324
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,070
for enough money to actually
pay for the cost of sale.

325
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,199
So you have cost of sale
risk.

326
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,810
If your consumer product
you'll have

327
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,340
viral growth risk.

328
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,400
Well you get the thinner
viral growth.

329
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,120
And so, I'll start up at the
very beginning.

330
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,220
Is basically just this long,
this long list of risks.

331
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,570
Right, and then, the way I
always think about running

332
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,320
a start up is also the way I
think about raising money,

333
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,580
which is a process of

334
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,050
peeling away layers of risk
as you go, right.

335
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,560
And so you raise seed money,

336
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,190
in order to peel away the
first two or

337
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,100
three risks, right.

338
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,050
The founding team risk, the
product risk.

339
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,620
Maybe the initial watch
risk.

340
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,970
You raise the a round to
peel away the next level of

341
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,750
product risk.

342
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,265
Maybe you appeal away some
recruiting risk,

343
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,610
'cuz you get your full
engineering team built.

344
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,440
And maybe you peel away some
customer risk,

345
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,690
cuz you get your first phi
beta customers, right?

346
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,430
And so, basically, the way
to think about it,

347
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,570
is, you're peeling away
risk, as you go.

348
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,330
You're peeling away risk by
achieving milestones.

349
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,710
And then, as you achieve
milestones,

350
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,430
you're both making progress
in your business.

351
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,310
And you're justifying
raising more capital, right?

352
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,850
And so you come in and you
pitch somebody like us.

353
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,990
And you say you're raising
your B round.

354
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,890
You know, the best way to do
that with us is you

355
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,280
say okay, I raised the seed
round.

356
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,930
I achieved these milestones,
I eliminated these risks.

357
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,790
I raised the A round,

358
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,120
I achieved these milestones,
I eliminated these risks.

359
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,030
Now I'm gonna raise a B
round.

360
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,930
Here are milestones.

361
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,720
Here are my risks.

362
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,440
And then by the time a go to
raise the seed round,

363
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,080
here's the, here's the state
that I'll be in.

364
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,180
And then you calibrate the
amount of

365
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,710
money that you've raised to
spend to

366
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,905
the risks that you're
pulling out of the business.

367
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,940
And I go through all this,

368
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,490
in a sense this sounds kind
of obvious, but

369
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,340
I go through all this cuz
it's a systematic way to

370
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,510
think about how the money
gets raised and deployed.

371
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,390
As compared to so

372
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,930
much of what's happening
especially these days.

373
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,470
Which is just oh my god let
me go raise as

374
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,930
much money as I can, let me
go build the fancy offices,

375
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,630
let me go hire as many
people as I can and

376
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,000
just kind of hope for the
best.

377
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,560
>> I'm gonna be tactical.

378
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,870
For sure don't ask people to
sign an NDA.

379
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,540
We rarely get asked anymore
because most founders have

380
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,670
figured out.

381
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,970
That if you ask somebody for

382
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,590
an NDA at the front end of
the relationship,

383
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,850
your basically saying, I
don't trust you.

384
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,660
So the relationship between
investors and

385
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,300
founders involves lots of
trust.

386
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,240
The biggest mistake that I
see by far.

387
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,900
Is not getting things in
writing.

388
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,620
You know the, my advice on
the fund raising process is

389
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,700
do it as quickly and

390
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,940
as efficiently as you
possibly can,

391
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,770
don't obsess over it.

392
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,990
For some reason, founders
get their ego involved in

393
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,890
fundraising, where it's a
personal victory.

394
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,480
It is the tiniest step on
the way, as Mark said.

395
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,964
And it's, it's the most
fundamental.

396
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:57,007
Hurry up and get it over
with.

397
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,403
But in the process when

398
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,687
somebody makes a commitment
to you.

399
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,886
You get in your car and you
type an email to

400
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:08,050
them that confirms what they
just said to you.

401
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,120
Because investors have, a
lot of investors have

402
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,310
very short memories and they
forget that they committed

403
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,350
to you that they were going
to finance.

404
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,730
Or they forget what the
valuation was, or

405
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,340
that they were going to find
a co-investor.

406
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,340
You can get rid of all that
controversy just by putting

407
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,190
it in writing, and when they
try and

408
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,220
get out of it you just
resend the email and

409
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,380
say, excuse me and

410
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,650
hopefully they've replied to
that email anyway.

411
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,170
So get it in writing.

412
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,330
In meetings take notes and,
and

413
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,879
follow up on what's
important.

414
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,450
>> I want to talk a little
bit more about tactics here.

415
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,600
Just how does the process
go?

416
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,300
Can people email you guys
directly?

417
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,570
Do they need to get an
introduction?

418
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,840
How many meetings does it
take for

419
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,800
you to make a decision?

420
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,050
How do you figure out what
the right terms are?

421
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,320
When can a founder ask you
for a check?

422
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,380
>> Do you wanna?

423
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,890
That was about it.

424
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,940
That was like six questions.

425
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,690
>> That's a lot of things.

426
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,280
>> Yeah, okay, good.

427
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,670
>> It's the process.

428
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,112
>> Why don't you describe,
why don't you describe,

429
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:05,495
cuz you'll describe seed
then I'll describe.

430
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,420
>> Yeah, yeah.
So yeah.

431
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,310
So, SV Angel, you know,

432
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,420
invests in seed stages
start-ups.

433
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,810
So we like to be the very
first investor.

434
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,530
We normally invest today at
around that's a million to

435
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,340
two million.

436
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,330
It used to only be a
million.

437
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,520
So if we invest 250k that
means there's five or

438
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,780
six other investors in that
syndicate.

439
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,140
SV Angel has now a staff of
13 people.

440
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,500
I do no due diligence
anymore.

441
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,720
I am not a picker anymore.

442
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,230
I just help on major
projects for

443
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,540
the portfolio companies that
are starting to mature.

444
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,030
But we have a whole team
that processes.

445
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,260
We at SV Angel end up
investing in one company for

446
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,280
every 30 that we look at,
and

447
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,810
we end up investing in about
one a week.

448
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,060
I think what's interesting
is we don't really take

449
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,560
anything over the transom.

450
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,740
Our network is so huge now
that we basically just take

451
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,830
leads from our own network.

452
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,440
We evaluate the opportunity
which means you have to

453
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,250
send in a really great short
executive summary.

454
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,740
And if we like that we
actually vote,

455
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,090
although I'm not in this
meeting anymore, but

456
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,650
the group actually votes on
do we make a phone call.

457
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,870
That's how important time is
in this process.

458
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,130
And if enough of the team at
SV thinks it's

459
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,190
interesting, then they
appoint a person to

460
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,710
make a phone call to that
founder,

461
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,050
usually somebody on our team
who has domain experience.

462
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,700
If the phone call goes well,
bingo, we want to meet you.

463
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,740
If SV Angel asks you for

464
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,980
a meeting we are well on our
way to investing.

465
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,299
If that meeting goes well,

466
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,660
we'll do some background
checks.

467
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,150
Backdoor background checks.

468
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,960
Get a good feeling about the
company.

469
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,540
The market that they're
going after.

470
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,150
And then, and then make the
commitment to invest.

471
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,330
And then start, start
helping get other value add

472
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,660
investors to be part of the
syndicate.

473
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,490
Because if we're gonna have

474
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,720
an equal workload we want
the other investors in

475
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,870
this company to be great
angel investors as well.

476
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,790
>> So I'll talk a little bit
about the venture stage and

477
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,680
the series A stage, you
know, the problems.

478
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,460
So to start with, I think
it's fair to say at

479
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,910
the point that all that top
tier venture capitalist

480
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,840
pretty much only invest in
two kinds of companies.

481
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,860
At the series A stage.

482
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,390
One is if

483
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,750
they have previously raised
a seed round.

484
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,450
And so, it's, it's almost
always case when were doing

485
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,565
a series A investment and
the company has a million or

486
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,010
$2 million in seed
financing.

487
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,300
You know from, from Ron and,
and

488
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,419
folks that he likes to work
with.

489
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,200
Almost always by the way Ron
just to be clear.

490
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,000
And folks he likes to work
with.

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,850
So first either they have a
seed round.

492
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,800
So if you're going to raise
serious aid

493
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,245
the first thing to do is
raise seed.

494
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:07,650
Cuz that's generally the way
the progression works at

495
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,715
this, at this point.

496
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,390
Every once in a while we'll
go straight to a on

497
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,540
a on a company that hasn't
raised the seed rounds.

498
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,830
Really the only times though
that,

499
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,320
that happens are when it's a
founder who has

500
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,840
been a successful founder in
the past, and is almost

501
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,740
certainly somebody we've
worked with in the past.

502
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,230
So actually we have an
announcement we just,

503
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,750
we just one of these we'll
announce in a few weeks.

504
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,950
Where it's founder who I was
an angel investor,

505
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,950
actually I think Ryan was
also in the team's

506
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,270
company in 2006.

507
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,740
And then the company did its
thing and

508
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,110
ultimately was acquired
another big company.

509
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,020
And then that team now is,
is starting their new thing.

510
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,880
So, in that case, we're just
gonna jump straight to

511
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,000
an A cuz they're so, they're
so well-known and

512
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,190
they have have a plan all
lined up for it.

513
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,600
But, you know, that, that's
the exception.

514
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,540
It's almost always
proceeded,

515
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,470
proceeded by a seed round.

516
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,650
The other thing is yeah I

517
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,220
guess I mentioned this
already, but we, we,

518
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,150
get, similar to what Ron
said, we get 2000 referrals

519
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,550
a year through our referral
network.

520
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,610
A very large percentage of

521
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,320
those are referrals through
the seed investors.

522
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,730
And so, by far, the best way
to get to, the, the,

523
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,620
by far the best way to get
investor introductions to

524
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,080
the A stage investor firms
is to be able,

525
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,785
is to work through the seed
investors.

526
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:12,977
Or to work through something
like

527
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,770
>> Speaking about terms.

528
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,890
what, what terms should
founders care most about?

529
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,350
And how should founders
negotiate?

530
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,620
Maybe Parker, we'll start
with you on this one.

531
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,190
>> Sure.
Well I think

532
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,490
probably precisely because
of what Mark said.

533
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,860
The most important thing at
the seed stage is picking

534
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,560
the right seed investors,
because they're gonna sort
