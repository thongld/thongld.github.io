Good afternoon.

2
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:08,151
Today's speaker is Peter
Thiel.

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:10,568
Peter, was the founder of
PayPal, and

4
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:14,159
Palantir, and Founders Fund,
and has invested in most of

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,591
the tech companies in
Silicon Valley.

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:19,279
And he's going to talk about
strategy and competition.

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:19,790
Thank you for coming, Peter.
>> Awesome.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,640
Thanks, Sam.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,410
Thanks for inviting me.

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,542
Thanks for having me.

11
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:29,118
I sorta, I have a single a
day

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,040
fixed that I'm completely
obsessed with in.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,080
On the business side which
is that, if you're starting

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,120
a company, if you're the
founder,

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,670
entrepreneur starting a
company,

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,680
you always want to aim for

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,240
monopoly, and that you want
to always avoid competition.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,250
Hence, competition is for
losers.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,740
Something we'll be talking
about today.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,930
I'd like to start by saying
something

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,980
about the basic idea of when
you start one

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,580
of these companies how you
go about, creating value?

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,992
And this question, what
makes a business valuable?

24
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:12,180
And I wanna, suggest that
there's basically,

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,080
a very simple very simple
formula that

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,430
you, have a valuable company
two things are true.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,210
Number one, that it creates
X dollars of value for

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,250
the world.

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,339
And number two, that you
capture Y% of X.

30
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:34,460
And the critical thing that
I think people always miss

31
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,970
in the sort of analysis is
that X and y are completely

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,710
independent variables, and
so X can be very big.

33
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,960
Y can be very small.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,830
X can be of intermediate
size.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,450
And if Y is, is reasonably
big you can still get

36
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,780
a very big business.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,900
So, to create a valuable
company you have to

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,910
basically, both create
something of value and

39
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,180
capture some fraction of

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,160
the value of what you've
created.

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,930
And sort of,

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,070
just to illustrate this is a
contrast.

43
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,190
If you sorta, compare the US
airline industry with

44
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,440
a company like Google on
search.

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,470
If you sorta, measure by

46
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,160
the size of these industries
you could, you could say

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,920
that airlines are still more
important than search.

48
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,400
If you just measure it say
by revenues.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,930
There's 195 billion.

50
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,750
In domestic revenues in
2012.

51
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,310
Google had just north of 50
billion.

52
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,390
And certainly, sort of on
some intuitive level,

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,520
if you said, if you were
given a choice and

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,350
said well do you want to get
rid of all air travel.

55
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,690
Or do you want to get rid of
your ability to

56
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,940
use search engines?

57
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,520
The intuition would be that
air travel is

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,300
something that's more
important than search.

59
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,850
And this is, of course, just
the domestic numbers.

60
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,490
If you had looked at this
globally, airlines are much,

61
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,920
much bigger than search, or
Google, is But

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,520
the profit margins are quite
a bit less.

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,060
You know,

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,180
they were marginally
profitable in 2012.

65
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,750
Think entire hundred year
history of

66
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,940
the airline industry.

67
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,310
The cumulative profits in
the U.S.

68
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,030
have been approximately
zero.

69
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,180
The companies make money.

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,510
They episodically go
bankrupt.

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,130
They get re-capitalized and

72
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,400
you sort of cycle and
repeat.

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,480
And this is reflected in you
know the combined market

74
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,780
capitalization of the
airline industries maybe

75
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,400
something of the U.S.
airline industry.

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,760
Something like a quarter
that of Google.

77
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,400
So, you have a search engine
much,

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,880
much smaller than air travel
but much more valuable and

79
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,740
I think this reflects these
very different valuations on

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,370
X and Y.

81
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,070
So, you know, if we look at
perfect competition.

82
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,570
You know there are, sort of,
there's some pros and

83
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,270
cons to the world of perfect
competition.

84
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,550
On a high level it's always,

85
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,720
this is what you study in
Econ One.

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,010
It's always, it's easy to
model, which I think is why

87
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,060
Econ professors like talking
about perfect competition.

88
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,290
It somehow is efficient,
especially,

89
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,290
in a world where things are
static because you have all

90
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,990
the consumer surplus gets
captured by everybody.

91
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,810
And politically, it's what
we're told is good in

92
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,260
our society, that you want
to have competition and

93
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,950
this is somehow a good
thing.

94
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,710
Of course, there are a lot
of negatives.

95
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,870
It's generally not that good
if you're.

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,095
You're involvement in
anything that's

97
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,280
hyper-competitive because
you often don't

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,700
make money off, come back to
this a little bit later.

99
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,960
So, I think at one end of
the spectrum you have

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,490
industries that are
perfectly competitive.

101
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,330
And at the other end of the
spectrum you have

102
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,950
things that, I would say,
are monopolies.

103
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,910
And they're much stable,
longer term businesses,

104
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,010
you have more capital.

105
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,700
And if you get a creative
monopoly for

106
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,800
inventing something new, I
think it's symptomatic of

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,060
having created something
really valuable.

108
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,370
And so I do think this, the
extreme binary view of

109
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,110
the world I always
articulate is that

110
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,930
there are exactly two kinds
of businesses in this world.

111
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,870
There are businesses that
are perfectly competitive

112
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,380
and there are businesses
that are monopolies.

113
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,200
And, there's shockingly
little that is in between.

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,260
And this dichotomy is not
understood very

115
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,670
well because people are
constantly lying

116
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,190
about the nature of the
businesses they're in.

117
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,750
And this is why,

118
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,750
this is in my mind, this is
the most important.

119
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,070
It's not necessarily the
most important thing in

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,060
business, but I think it's
the most

121
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,000
important business idea that
people don't understand.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
That there are just these
two kinds of businesses.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,130
And so let me

124
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,356
say a little bit about the
lies that people tell.

125
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:42,420
And so you basically, the
basic, if you sort of

126
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,680
imagine that there was a
spectrum of companies from

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,190
perfect competition to
monopoly.

128
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,570
The apparent differences are
quite small.

129
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,680
Because the people who have
monopolies pretend not to.

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,470
They will basically say, and
it's because you

131
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,280
don't want to get regulated
by the government, you

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,480
don't want the government to
come after you.

133
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,520
So you will never say that
you have a monopoly.

134
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,330
So, anyone who has a
monopoly will pretend that

135
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,040
they're in incredible
competition.

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,110
And on the other end of the
spectrum, if you

137
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,210
are incredibly competitive,
and if you're in some sort

138
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,720
of business will you will
never make any money.

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,380
You will be tempted to tell
a lie that goes in

140
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,130
the other direction.

141
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,120
Where you will say that
you're doing something

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,980
unique that is somehow less
competitive than it looks.

143
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,400
Because you will want to
differentiate, you

144
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,300
will want to track capital
or something like that.

145
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,760
So, if the monopolists
pretend not to have

146
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,700
a monopolies the
non-monopolists pretend to

147
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,850
have monopolies.

148
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,960
The apparent difference is
very small.

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
Where as the real difference
I would submit is

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
actually quite big.

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,190
And so there's this
distortion that happens

152
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,660
because of the lies people
tell about their businesses.

153
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,830
And the lies are sort of in
these opposite directions.

154
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,160
Let me, drill a little bit
down further on the way

155
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,238
these lies work.

156
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:04,121
And so

157
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:08,630
the basic lie you tell as

158
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,590
a non-monopoly is that we're
in a very small market.

159
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,570
The basic lie you tell as a
monopoly is

160
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,169
that the market you're in is
much bigger than it looks.

161
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,770
And so typically,

162
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,310
if you want to think this in
sort of set theoretic terms.

163
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,580
You could say that a
monopoly tells a why,

164
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,670
where you describe your
business as the union of

165
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,430
these vastly different
markets, and

166
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,132
the non-monopolies describes
it as the intersection.

167
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:42,030
So, that in effect, if
you're non-monopolist, you

168
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,510
will rhetorically describe
your market as super small.

169
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,660
You're the only person in
that market.

170
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,540
If you have monopoly, you'll
describe it as super big,

171
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,550
and there's lots of
competition in it.

172
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,930
So some examples of how this
works in practice.

173
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,470
So I always use restaurants
as the example of

174
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,460
a terrible business.

175
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,780
And there's always, sort of,
ideas that,

176
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,370
you know, capitalism and
competition are antonyms.

177
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,150
Capital, someone who
accumulates capital.

178
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,450
World of perfect competition
is

179
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,000
a world where all the
capital gets competed away.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,430
So, you're opening a
restaurant business.

181
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,670
No one wants to invest
because you just lose money.

182
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,280
So you have to tell some
idiosyncratic narrative.

183
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,100
And you will say something
like, well,

184
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,780
we're the only British food
restaurant in Paolo Alto.

185
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,460
So, it's British, Paolo
Alto.

186
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,310
And of course,

187
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,000
that's too small a market
because people may be able

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,220
to drive all the way to
Mountain View or even Park.

189
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,800
And there probably no people
who eat nothing but

190
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,440
British food.

191
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,080
At least, no people are
still alive.

192
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,090
And so that is sort of a
fictitiously narrow market.

193
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,130
There's sort of a Hollywood
version of this where.

194
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,560
The way movies always get
pitched is, it's like

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,570
a college football star,
joins an elite group of

196
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,840
hackers to catch the shark
that killed his friends.

197
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,960
So, that is a movie that has
not been made.

198
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,280
But the question is,

199
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,680
is that the right category
or is the correct category?

200
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,380
It's just another movie, in
which case, you know,

201
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,570
there are lots of those,
it's super competitive,

202
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,170
incredibly had to make
money.

203
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,690
No one ever makes money in
Hollywood doing movies.

204
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,570
It's really hard.

205
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,940
And so you always have this
question about.

206
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,410
Does the intersection, does,

207
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,290
is it real, does it make
sense,

208
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,940
does it have value that one
should ask?

209
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,210
And of course, there are
start up versions of this.

210
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,210
Where you, and the sort of
the really bad versions you

211
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,620
just take a whole series of
buzz words.

212
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,170
Sharing, mobile, social,
apps, you combine them,

213
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,270
and you have some kind of
narrative.

214
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,640
And, whether or not, that's
a real business or not,

215
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,860
is, it's generally a bad
sign.

216
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,120
So it's, it's almost this
pattern recognition when you

217
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,070
have this rhetoric of this

218
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,760
sort of intersections, it
generally does not work.

219
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,350
The something of

220
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,680
somewhere is really mostly
just the nothing of nowhere.

221
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,310
It's like the Stanford of
North Dakota.

222
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,960
One of a kind, but it's not
Stanford.

223
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,800
So, let's look at the
opposite.

224
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,451
The opposite lie, is if you
are, let's say,

225
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:26,140
the search, company, that's
down the street from here.

226
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,040
And has about a happy 66%
market share and, you know?

227
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,100
Is completely dominant in
the search market.

228
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,000
Google has not almost never
describes itself.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,310
As a search engine, these
days.

230
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,180
And instead, it describes
itself in all these

231
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,760
different ways.

232
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,590
So, it sometimes says it's
an advertising company.

233
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,570
So, if it was search, you'd
say, well, it's, like, it

234
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,420
has this huge market share
that's really, really crazy.

235
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,310
It's like a incredible
monopoly.

236
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,010
It's much bigger than, it's
much,

237
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,140
much more robust monopoly
than Microsoft,

238
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,380
ever had in the 90s.

239
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,510
Maybe that's why it's making
so much money.

240
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,010
But if you say it's an
advertising market,

241
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,930
you could say,

242
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,590
well, there's search
advertising is 17 billion.

243
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,490
And that's part of online
advertising,

244
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,450
which is much bigger.

245
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,000
And then, all US advertising
is bigger.

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,330
And then by the time you get
to global advertising,

247
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,300
that's close to 500 billion.

248
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,322
And so you're talking about
3.5%.

249
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:30,810
So a tiny part of this much
larger market.

250
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:35,150
Or if you don't want it to
be an advertising company

251
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,930
you could always say that
you're a technology company.

252
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:43,250
And so sorry.

253
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,622
Let me just see.

254
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:48,660
And so

255
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,780
the technology market is
something like a $1 trillion

256
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,690
market, and the narrative
that you tell is that Google

257
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,430
in the technology market is
well we're competing with

258
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,160
all the car companies with
our self-driving cars,

259
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,470
we're competing with Apple
on TVs and iPhones.

260
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,010
We're competing with
Facebook.

261
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,760
We're competing with
Microsoft on office

262
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,200
products, we're competing
with Amazon on cloud

263
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,490
services, and so, we are in
this giant technology market

264
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,090
where there's competition in
every direction you look.

265
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,880
And no we're

266
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,180
not the monopoly the
government's looking for and

267
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,830
we should not get regulated
in any way whatsoever.

268
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,870
And so I think one has to
always be super aware that

269
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,280
there are these very
powerful incentives

270
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,290
to distort the nature of
these markets

271
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,380
one way or the other.

272
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,920
So, the evidence of the
narrow markets in

273
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,490
the tech industry is if you
basically just.

274
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
If you look at sort of the,
some of the big

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,370
tech companies, Apple,
Google, Microsoft,

276
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,720
Amazon, they just they've
just been building up

277
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,860
cash for year after year and
you have these incredibly

278
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,250
high profit margins and I
would, I would say that the.

279
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,900
That one of the reasons the
tech industry in the US.

280
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,220
Has been so successful
financially.

281
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,300
Is because it's prone to
creating all these monopoly

282
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,170
like business.

283
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,040
And that's and

284
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,070
it's reflected by these
companies.

285
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,890
Just accumulate so much
cash.
