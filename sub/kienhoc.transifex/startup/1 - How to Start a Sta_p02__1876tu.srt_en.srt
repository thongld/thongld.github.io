256
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI
That just sounds terrible
all around.

257
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
These all sounded really
bad,

258
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,870
but they turned out to be
good.

259
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,180
If they had sounded really
good,

260
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,100
there would have been too
many people working on them.

261
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,620
As Peter Tills discussed in
the fifth class,

262
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,020
you want an idea that turns
into a monopoly, but

263
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,040
you can't get a monopoly in
a big market right away.

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,960
Too much competition for
that.

265
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,580
You have to find a small
market in which you can get

266
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,211
a monopoly, and then quickly
expand.

267
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,380
This is why some great
startup ideas look

268
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,330
really bad at the beginning.

269
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,720
It's good if you can say
something like, today only

270
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,130
the small subset of users
are going to use my product.

271
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,710
But I'm gonna get all of
them.

272
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,383
And in the future,

273
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,740
almost everyone will use my
product.

274
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,720
>> Here's the thing that's
gonna come up a lot,

275
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,230
you need conviction in your
own beliefs, and

276
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,810
the willingness to ignore
others nay saying.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,440
The hard part is that this
is a very fine line.

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,910
There's right on one side of
it, and crazy on the other.

279
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,240
But keep in mind that if you
do come up with

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,300
a great idea, most people
are going to think it's bad.

281
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,980
You should be happy about
that.

282
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,460
It means they won't compete
with you.

283
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,800
This is also a reason why
it's

284
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,750
not usually dangerous to
tell people about your idea.

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,520
The truly good ideas don't
sound like

286
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,190
they're worth stealing.

287
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,640
You want an idea about which
you can say,

288
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,500
I know it sounds like a bad
idea.

289
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,240
But hear specifically why
it's actually a great one.

290
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,180
You wanna sound crazy, but
you wanna actually be right.

291
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,280
And you want an idea that
not many

292
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,060
other people are working on.

293
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,470
And it's okay if it doesn't
sound big at first.

294
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,800
Common mistake among
founders,

295
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,380
especially first time
founders,

296
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,830
is they think that the first
version of their product,

297
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,440
the first version of their
idea,

298
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,910
needs to sound really big.

299
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,440
But it doesn't.

300
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
It needs to take over a
small,

301
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,460
specific market and expand
from there.

302
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,880
That's how most great
companies have started.

303
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,580
Unpopular but right is what
you're going for.

304
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,210
You want something that
sounds like a bad idea, but

305
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,840
is a good idea.

306
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,870
You also really wanna take
the time to

307
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,350
think about how the market's
going to evolve.

308
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,620
You need a market that's
going to be big in

309
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,320
ten years.

310
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,729
Most investors are obsessed
with the market size today,

311
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,834
and they don't think at all
about how the market is

312
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,190
going to evolve.

313
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,560
In fact, I think this is one
of the biggest

314
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,010
systemic mistakes that
investors make.

315
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,250
They think about the growth
of the startup itself,

316
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,640
they don't think about the
growth of the market.

317
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,370
I care much more about the
growth rate of

318
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,050
the market than it's current
size.

319
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,720
And I also care if

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,010
there's any reason that it's
gonna top out.

321
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,350
You should think about this.

322
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,150
I'd prefer to invest in

323
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,850
a company that's going after
a small but

324
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,410
rapidly growing market than
a big but slow growing one.

325
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,660
One of the big advantages of
these sorts of markets um,

326
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,930
these small but rapidly
growing markets, is that

327
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,640
customers are usually pretty
desperate for a solution.

328
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,358
And they'll put, put up with
an imperfect but

329
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:13,470
rapidly improving product.

330
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,980
And a big advantage of being
a student, one of

331
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,780
the two biggest advantages
is that you probably have

332
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,170
better intuition about which
markets are likely to

333
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,660
start growing rapidly than
older people do.

334
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,640
Another thing that students
usually don't understand, or

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,630
at least takes a while you
cannot create a market that

336
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,120
doesn't want to exist.

337
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,370
You can basically change
everything in

338
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,180
a startup but the market.

339
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,760
So you should actually do
some thinking, to be sure or

340
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,810
at least as sure as you can
be, that the market your

341
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,460
going after is going to grow
and be there.

342
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,460
There are a lot of different
ways to

343
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,040
talk about the right kind of
market.

344
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,980
For example, surfing someone
else's wave or

345
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,420
stepping into an up elevator
or being part of a movement.

346
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,110
But all of this is just a
way of saying you want

347
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,200
a market that's going to
grow really quickly.

348
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,100
It may seem small today.

349
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,340
It may be small today.

350
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,040
But you know, and

351
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,900
other people don't that it's
gonna grow really fast.

352
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,660
So think about where this is
happening in the world.

353
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,240
You need this sort of

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,880
a tail wind to make a
startup successful.

355
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
The exciting thing is there
are probably more of

356
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,010
these tail winds now than
ever before.

357
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,841
As Mark Andreessen says,

358
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,810
software is eating the
world.

359
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,810
It's just everywhere.

360
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,190
There are like, so many
great ideas out there and

361
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,130
you just have to pick one,
and

362
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,220
find one that you really
care about.

363
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,877
Another version of this,

364
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,585
that would, gets down to the
same idea,

365
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:25,570
is Sequoia's famous
question.

366
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,870
Why now?

367
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,510
Why is this the perfect time
for this particular idea and

368
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,310
to start this particular
company?

369
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,140
Why couldn't it have been
done two years ago?

370
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,500
And why will two years in
the future be too late?

371
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,165
For the most successful
startups we've been

372
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,915
involved with, they've all
had a great idea,

373
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,110
great answer to this
question.

374
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,030
And if you don't, you should
be at

375
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,170
least somewhat suspicious
about it.

376
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,530
In general, it's best if

377
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,940
you're building something
that you yourself need.

378
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,180
You'll understand it much
better than if you have to

379
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,040
understand it by talking to

380
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,650
a customer to build the very
first version.

381
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,440
If you don't know it
yourself and

382
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,610
you're building something
that someone else needs,

383
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,670
realize that you're at a big
disadvantage and get very,

384
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,200
very close to your
customers.

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,510
Try to work in their office
if you can.

386
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,458
And if not, talk to them
multiple times a day.

387
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,910
Another somewhat
counter-intuitive thing

388
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,220
about good start up ideas,

389
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,720
is that they're almost
always very easy to explain,

390
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,400
and very easy to understand.

391
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,660
If it takes more than a
sentence to

392
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,210
explain what you're doing
um,

393
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,170
it's almost always a sign
that it's too complicated.

394
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,860
It should be a clearly
articulate,

395
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,800
articulated vision with a
small number of words.

396
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,020
And the best ideas are
usually either,

397
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,460
very different from existing
companies in one

398
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,800
important way.

399
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,620
Like Google being a search
engine that worked

400
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,540
just really well and none of
the other stuff of

401
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,750
the portals or totally new,
like Space X.

402
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,080
Any company that's a clone
of

403
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
something else that already
exists with some small or

404
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,310
made up differentiator,

405
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,280
like we're gonna be x
beautiful design or

406
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,340
we're gonna be y for people
that like red wine instead.

407
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,170
That usually fails.

408
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,890
So as I mentioned one of the
great things about being

409
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,820
a student is you

410
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,520
have a very good perspective
on new technology.

411
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,110
And learning to get good at
having new

412
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,750
ideas takes a while.

413
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,930
So start working on that
right now.

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,550
That's one thing we hear
from people all the time,

415
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,550
that they wish they had

416
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,530
done more when they were a
student.

417
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,514
The other is meeting
potential co-founders.

418
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,170
You have no idea how good of
an environment you are in

419
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,210
right now for meeting people
that you

420
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,110
can start a company with
down the road.

421
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,860
And the one thing that we

422
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,680
always tell college
students, is more

423
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,150
important than starting any
particular startup

424
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,870
is getting to know a lot of
potential co-founders.

425
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,400
So I want to finish this
section of my talk

426
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,820
with a quote from 50 Cent.

427
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,190
This is from when he was
asked about vitamin water.

428
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,050
I won't read it, its up
there.

429
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,600
But it's about the
importance of

430
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,730
thinking about what
customers want, and

431
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,050
thinking about the demands
of the market.

432
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,470
Most people don't do this,

433
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,090
most students especially
don't do this.

434
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,410
If you can just do this one
thing, if you can just

435
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,990
learn to think about the
market first, you will have

436
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,430
a big leg up on most people
starting startups.

437
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,040
All right, and this is
something.

438
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,060
This is probably the thing
that we

439
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,390
see wrong with Y Combinator
apps most frequently, is

440
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,090
that people have not thought
about the market first.

441
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,040
And what people want first.

442
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,570
So for the next section,

443
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm gonna talk about
building a great product.

444
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,568
And here again,

445
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm gonna use a very broad
definition of product.

446
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,242
It includes customer support
and

447
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,280
copyright explaining the
product.

448
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,220
Anything involved in your
customer's interaction with

449
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,880
what you built for them.

450
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,890
To build a really great
company, you first have to

451
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,080
turn a great idea into a
great product.

452
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,260
This is really hard, but
it's crucially important,

453
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,250
and fortunately it's pretty
fun.

454
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,760
Although great products are
always new to the world and

455
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,290
it's hard to give you advice
about what to build,

456
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,010
there are enough
commonalities that we

457
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,000
can give you a lot of advice
about how to build it.

458
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,680
One of the most important
tasks for a founder is to

459
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,140
make sure that the company
builds a great product.

460
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,740
Until you've built a great
product,

461
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,540
almost nothing else matters.

462
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,100
When really successful
startup founders tell

463
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,890
the story of their early
days.

464
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,350
It's almost always sitting
in front of the computer,

465
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,080
working on their product or
talking to their customers.

466
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,270
That's pretty much all the
time.

467
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,930
They do very little else,
and

468
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,640
you should be very skeptical
if your time allocation is

469
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,140
much different.

470
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,880
Most other problems that
founders are trying to

471
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,070
solve, raising money,
getting more press,

472
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,060
hiring, business
development, et cetera.

473
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,260
These are significantly
easier when you

474
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,819
have a great product.

475
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,970
It's really important to
take care of that first.

476
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,760
Step 1, is to build
something that users love.

477
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,380
At YC, we tell founders to
work on their product,

478
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,230
talk to users, exercise eat
and

479
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,360
sleep and very little else.

480
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,990
All the other stuff I just
mentioned, PR conferences,

481
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
recruiting advisers, doing
partnerships,

482
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,810
you should ignore all of
that and

483
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,990
just build a product.

484
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,160
And get it as good as
possible by

485
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,020
talking to your users.

486
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,870
Your job is to build
something that users love.

487
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,150
Very few companies that go
on to be

488
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,320
super successful get there
without first doing this.

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,590
A lot of good on paper
startups fail because they

490
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,830
merely make something that
people like.

491
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,115
Making something that people
want,

492
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,450
but only a medium amount is
a great way to fail and

493
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,300
not understand why you're
failing.

494
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,270
So these are the two jobs.

495
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,770
Something that we say at

496
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,080
YC a lot is that it's better
to build a small number,

497
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,950
it's better to build
something that a small

498
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,510
number of users love than a
large number of users like.

499
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,570
Of course, it'd be best to

500
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,840
build something that a small
number of users love.

501
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,570
But opportunities to do that
for V1 are rare, and

502
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,190
they're usually not
available to startups.

503
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,020
So in practice,

504
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,140
you end up choosing either
the grey or the orange.

505
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,380
You make something that a
lot of users like a little

506
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,570
bit, or something that a
small number of users,

507
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,520
like, love a lot.

508
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,040
And this is a very important
piece of advice.

509
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
Build something that a small
number of users love.

510
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,450
It's much easier to expand
from something that
