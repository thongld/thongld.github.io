889
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE
Groupon at this point was

890
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,700
like the fastest growing
company in the world ever.

891
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,350
First company to,

892
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,580
fastest company to a billion
dollars in revenue.

893
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,080
And then they stopped doing
Groupon.

894
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,420
This is when Groupon was on
top of the world.

895
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,730
And they cloned us.

896
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,890
And we had 40 employees.

897
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,070
We had raised $7 million.

898
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,680
They cloned us, and they
raised $90 million.

899
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,370
And, in 30 days, they hired
400 people.

900
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,840
And they wanted to sell the
company and if they

901
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,510
couldn't, they were gonna
destroy us around the world.

902
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,120
And the problem with

903
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,610
Airbnb is if we're not
everywhere around the world.

904
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,530
Like, a travel site not
being in Europe is like

905
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,700
your phone not having email,
it doesn't actually work.

906
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,805
So we were kind of in
trouble.

907
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,180
And we had this conversation
and there was the pragmatic

908
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,910
decision of should we
acquire them and

909
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,010
then there was the values
decision.

910
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,351
The pragmatic one should've
probably have said buy

911
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:40,756
them because you can't risk
losing international.

912
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:43,013
So just guarantee you're
gonna get international.

913
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:45,660
But we ended up not buying
them.

914
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,460
And the reason we ended up
not buying them is I

915
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,590
just didn't like the
culture.

916
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,910
I didn't wanna bring in this
400 people.

917
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,080
I felt like we were
missionaries and

918
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,980
they were mercenaries.

919
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,670
I didn't think they were
doing it for the beliefs.

920
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,010
I thought they were doing it
to make a lot of

921
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,410
money very quickly.

922
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,780
And I believe in a war on

923
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,910
missionaries would outlast
and out-endure mercenaries.

924
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,960
And I also felt like the
best

925
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,770
revenge against an Internet
startup, Internet clone was

926
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,420
just to make them run the
company long term.

927
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,869
It's like you have the baby,
now you gotta raise it.

928
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,090
>> So.

929
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,800
>> That's what we ended up
dong.

930
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,860
And that was a very
controversial decision.

931
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,030
A lot of people are telling
me,

932
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,020
you should buy this company.

933
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,660
We didn't.

934
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,000
And I think it worked out.

935
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,920
>> Let's see, the last part
being how.

936
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,340
What percentage of revenue
comes from Europe?

937
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,100
>> More than 50%.

938
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,968
>> I think it worked out.

939
00:32:26,968 --> 00:32:28,121
>> Yeah.

940
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:32,170
>> All right, anybody have
any questions?

941
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,240
I can keep going.

942
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,691
Yeah, so one other question,
one other statement we had

943
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,200
at Zappos was that culture
and

944
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,080
brand were two sides of the
same coin.

945
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,480
>> Yes.

946
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,090
>> Airbnb has a great
culture and

947
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:42,810
also a great brand.

948
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,660
You wanna talk a little bit
about branding, since that's

949
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,970
actually a kind of a weak
thing in Silicon Valley.

950
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,190
We don't tend to focus on
this, on culture and brand.

951
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,020
>> Yeah.
Yeah, that's what

952
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,630
I actually just said that to
Sam Altman.

953
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,860
I think Silicon Valley is

954
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,870
not historically really
strong, or

955
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,970
we don't talk about culture
and brand very much.

956
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,230
They are two sides of the
same coin.

957
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,190
So cultural like the
principles and the beliefs

958
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,850
you have inside the company
that you want people to be

959
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,910
aligned with long term.

960
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,520
And whatever happens inside

961
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,000
the company eventually comes
out.

962
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
You can't hold it in.

963
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,550
And brand is really the
promise outside the company

964
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,952
that everyone identifies
with.

965
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:20,870
And so I think, having a
clear mission, and

966
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,360
making sure that you know
that mission, and

967
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,880
making sure that mission
comes through the company is

968
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
probably the most important
thing you can do for

969
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,360
both culture and values.

970
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,970
And then, the second thing
you need to know is

971
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,060
that your brand, the way
people think about you

972
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,970
as a company, is often
decided by your, you know,

973
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,944
your brand evangelists are
your employees.

974
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:40,160
And so you have a weak
culture.

975
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,560
And we often think that
companies that hire

976
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,180
employees or people that are
deeply passionate,

977
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,160
create companies that
customers are really,

978
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,040
really passionate about.

979
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,350
And those are the companies
that have strong brands.

980
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,448
And so, Zappos had a really
strong brand because they

981
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,120
have strong culture.

982
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,950
And a lot of companies,

983
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,676
Google, they care deeply
about the culture.

984
00:33:57,676 --> 00:33:58,520
They actually have a
question,

985
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,810
is this person googly?

986
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,944
And it's meant to be like, a
catchall for

987
00:34:01,944 --> 00:34:03,950
do they fit the Google
culture.

988
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,200
Google's a very strong
culture.

989
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,870
It's unique to Google.

990
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,830
And, by the way, there's no
such thing as a good or

991
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,550
bad culture.

992
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,980
It's either a strong or weak
culture.

993
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,810
And a good culture for

994
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,020
somebody else may not be a
good culture for you.

995
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,990
So, I think brand is

996
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,900
incredibly important as
well.

997
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,380
And brand is really the
connection of you with your

998
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,110
customers.

999
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,010
And so, if you have an
incredibly strong

1000
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,930
culture that can be a whole
talk and brand.

1001
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,740
But if you have a fairly
strong culture,

1002
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,170
then the brand will come
through.

1003
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,540
The final thing to say about
brand is,

1004
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,080
a lot of people when they
talk about their brand,

1005
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,490
they talk about what they
sell.

1006
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,048
So if you're Apple, one way
of doing it is to say,

1007
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:37,992
we sell computers.

1008
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:42,070
And like, our new screens
are larger and it's faster.

1009
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,160
And they talk about bits and
bytes.

1010
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,970
And I remember Steve Jobs
had this really important

1011
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,720
talk where he says the way
to win, this is 1997 when he

1012
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,600
first came back, wasn't to
talk about bits and bytes.

1013
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,090
The way to win is to talk
about what we value.

1014
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,020
And our core value is we
believe people with

1015
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,270
passion can change the
world.

1016
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,880
And that was how we

1017
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,890
introduced the Think
Different campaign.

1018
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,190
And so Apple before they had
this huge renaissance, which

1019
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,150
became the most valuable
company in the world.

1020
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,350
They did the Think Different
campaign,

1021
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,350
which is basically saying,
this is what we believe in.

1022
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,140
And if you buy an Apple
computer,

1023
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,370
you're also saying, I
believe in this, too.

1024
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,605
And there would have to be,

1025
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:14,109
I think, a deeper core
belief and

1026
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,216
if that doesn't happen,
you're a utility.

1027
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,239
And the utilities get sold
at commodity prices.

1028
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,870
>> Go ahead.

1029
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,471
>> How did you know how to
communicate this idea?

1030
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,820
>> How?

1031
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,840
The question is how do you
know how to communicate this

1032
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,480
to the company?

1033
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,630
The culture or the core
values.

1034
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,480
>> To the employees.

1035
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,660
To the outside world.

1036
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,710
>> The culture?

1037
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,600
The values.

1038
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,400
The brand?

1039
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,210
>> How to communicate what
Airbnb does

1040
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,430
>> Well, so

1041
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,070
the question is how do

1042
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,930
we communicate what Airbnb
does early in the days?

1043
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,250
Well, we learned a lot
because in the early days,

1044
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,950
we communicate like a
utility.

1045
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,080
We actually said Airbnb is a
cheap,

1046
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,520
affordable alternative to
hotels.

1047
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,690
And we had a tagline of
forget hotels,

1048
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,970
save money with Airbnb.

1049
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,570
And over time we felt like
that was,

1050
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,170
I mean this was in really
early days.

1051
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,660
And we felt like that was
way too limiting.

1052
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,102
That undercut the idea.

1053
00:36:08,102 --> 00:36:12,400
And so, we then eventually
changed our tag line to

1054
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,354
travel like a human.

1055
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,482
Which we haven't kept.

1056
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:19,095
But it was basically meant
to say that we believe in

1057
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,987
a certain kind of world and

1058
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:24,268
we really feel like travel
is mass produced.

1059
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,810
You feel isolated, you feel
like a stranger.

1060
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,569
And we want to bring the
world back to the place

1061
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,387
where it's a little bit like
a village again.

1062
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:32,661
Where the service is coming
from other people.

1063
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,159
You have this feeling like
you belong and

1064
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,950
you're actually treated like
a human.

1065
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,750
You know, no matter how
successful you are in life,

1066
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,070
often travelling will remind
you,

1067
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,210
you're not that successful.

1068
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,690
Go through TSA, stay in a
typical hotel.

1069
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,510
Sometimes you'll have some
problems.

1070
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,300
And so we really want to
make people feel special.

1071
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,070
And this was kind of some of
the stuff we did in

1072
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,080
the early days and we did a
lot of storytelling.

1073
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,270
I mean, I probably told the
story of

1074
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,370
Airbnb like 10,000 times.

1075
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,910
And this is something that's
kind of related to culture.

1076
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,209
But one, somebody asked me

1077
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:02,364
the other day like what's
the job of the CEO.

1078
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:04,172
And there's a number of
things a CEO does.

1079
00:37:04,172 --> 00:37:07,392
But what you mostly do is
articulate the vision.

1080
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,610
So you articulate the
vision,

1081
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,620
you gotta develop a strategy
and

1082
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,540
you gotta hire people to fit
the culture.

1083
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,870
If you do those three things
you

1084
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,460
basically have a company.

1085
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,250
And that company will
hopefully be successful.

1086
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,060
If you have the right
vision,

1087
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,410
the right strategy and good
people.

1088
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,890
So what we end up doing is

1089
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,270
articulating the vision over
and over and over again.

1090
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,470
Whether you're hiring people
or

1091
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,670
recruiting them, talking to
investors to raise money,

1092
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,360
doing PR interviews, if
you're speaking at a class.

1093
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,980
You're always reinforcing
the values.

1094
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,440
You're doing it in email to
a customer.

1095
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,060
And so you just do it
thousands of times.

1096
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,110
And if you do something
thousands of

1097
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,840
times it will change and get
better every time.

1098
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,880
So it's just kind of,
evolved.

1099
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,410
>> Yeah, question.
>> So

1100
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,510
you are interacting with the
host,

1101
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,890
somehow you're in charge of
the host and

1102
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,920
reinforcing the parts of
Airbnb?

1103
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,050
>> Very, very good question.

1104
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,950
How do we make sure

1105
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,245
the hosts are reinforcing
the culture of Airbnb?

1106
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:57,770
So when, the answer to that
is, we do a pretty good

1107
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,960
job but not yet an amazing
job at it.

1108
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,720
When we first started
Airbnb,

1109
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,780
I kinda took the Craig
Newmark school of thought.

1110
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,050
Craig Newmark's the founder
of Craigslist.

1111
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,450
And I said, anybody should
be able to use Airbnb.

1112
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,190
You didn't have to apply.

1113
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,180
If you wanted to rent your
place,

1114
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,620
you could rent your place.

1115
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,060
And it turned out that many
of

1116
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,604
the people believed in our
values because we

1117
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:19,070
talked about it and we
tracked them.

1118
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,570
But there were people who
rented on Airbnb not

1119
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,609
because they believed in
values, but because they

1120
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:24,666
realized they can make a lot
of money renting their home.

1121
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,510
And not everyone really was
a great culture fit.

1122
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,112
And these people actually
did cause us a lot of

1123
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:30,803
problems.

1124
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:32,945
So, that was actually a bit
of a lesson for me.

1125
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,985
And I didn't think our host
had to,

1126
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:37,710
it didn't really occur to me
in the early days.

1127
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,900
The host had to completely
fit the values,

1128
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,270
that we met them, we attract
people like us.

1129
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,880
And so, over time, we've
realized host or partners,

1130
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,312
and so they need to believe
in the same values we do.

1131
00:38:48,312 --> 00:38:52,190
And so now we have a program
called the Superhost

1132
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,030
program where they have to
demonstrate values to

1133
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,380
reach this kind of badge,
which gets them kind

1134
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,210
of priority customer support
and distribution.

1135
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,900
We are having this host
convention where you

1136
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,670
bring all the hosts in.

1137
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,350
We're gonna be talking about
and reinforcing the values.

1138
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,800
We're moving towards the
place where they have to

1139
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,090
apply to list.

1140
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,190
And we don't test them the
way we test an employee but

1141
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,680
we're starting to get more
rigorous about it.

1142
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,010
So the answer is, the answer
is we were really late but

1143
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,890
we now do it by gradually
moving towards apply to list

1144
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,975
and reinforcing it every
step of the way.

1145
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,470
>> Go ahead.

1146
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,440
>> When Airbnb has made some
great contributions to

1147
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,130
the open source community.

1148
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,130
Do you have any thoughts on
how that contributes to

1149
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,170
the culture of your
development team?

1150
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,204
>> Yeah.

1151
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,760
I think, just in general,
and

1152
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,110
it may be related to two
things about Airbnb.

1153
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,300
We tend to be a pretty open
culture, just in general.

1154
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,068
We communicate a lot.

1155
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:51,050
And we generally believe in
the idea of like,

1156
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,270
a shared world where people
are giving back and

1157
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,540
contributing, making
communities and

1158
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,880
industries stronger.

1159
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,768
So, just my one philosophy
on communication is,

1160
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:01,489
we basically communicate and

1161
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:04,518
talk about everything
internally except for things

1162
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:07,224
that relate to employee or
customer privacy.

1163
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:09,173
So, if it doesn't relate to
those two things,

1164
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,553
we'll basically talk about
it.

1165
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:12,524
As far as open source
culture and

1166
00:40:12,524 --> 00:40:15,225
engineering, we wanted to
make sure that we

1167
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:18,221
had a really strong
identification of the team.

1168
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:21,744
And so we really felt like a
lot of source codes

1169
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:23,043
shouldn't be,

1170
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:27,050
you know, we felt like every
company needs a moat.

1171
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,590
Some kind of

1172
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,760
moat that protects you from
your competition.

1173
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,620
We thought some technology
would be, but

1174
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,030
we also felt like we wanted
to be

1175
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,080
able to get back from a
technology standpoint.

1176
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,767
And we preferred our moat to
be that we provide the very

1177
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:41,288
best experience in the world
when you use Airbnb.

1178
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:43,117
We have the biggest network
effects.

1179
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:46,627
And we thought that kind of
took precedent over

1180
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:50,503
having certain technology
that only we could use.

1181
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:52,345
And so we decided to try to
share some of

1182
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:53,330
that out to people.

1183
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,600
And I think, again, it does
relate to the values.

1184
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,100
Now one other thing is I
never one day recommended.
