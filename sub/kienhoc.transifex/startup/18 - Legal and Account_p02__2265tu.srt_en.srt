276
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,411
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHzvmyMJEK4
were actually surprised that
they have to do something in

277
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,862
order to own this stock.

278
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,442
They think about, they think
that talking about this is,

279
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,234
is actually enough.

280
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:33,929
And this again is another
situation where you have to

281
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:35,704
think about you as an
individual,

282
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:38,650
versus you as a representative
of the company.

283
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,930
And if you, if you equate this
to a large company,

284
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,720
you know if you, if you worked
at Google and

285
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,090
you were told as part of your
compensation package,

286
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,410
that you would be receiving
some shares,

287
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,180
you would expect to sign
something to get those shares.

288
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,360
And if you didn't, you'd be
thinking,

289
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,930
oh what's going on here?

290
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,820
Well, it's the same thing
with,

291
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,310
with a small company as well.

292
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,340
So in this case the paper,
the, the documents that

293
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,920
you're signing is a stock
purchase agreement.

294
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,380
So you as an individual, buy
the shares from the company.

295
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,060
And in any situation, if
you're buying something,

296
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,460
there's a two-way transaction
where you pay for

297
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,199
something and you get
something in return.

298
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,870
And in this case you're
getting shares in return for

299
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,520
either a cash payment, or for
contributing IP, or

300
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,290
inventions, or code to the
company, so that the company

301
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,990
actually owns everything that
you've done in the past.

302
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,970
So, we also refer to that
stock being restricted

303
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,340
because it vests over time.

304
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,750
And we're going to cover that
next in more detail.

305
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,500
But, as a result of the stock
being restricted investing,

306
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,140
there's one very very crucial
piece of paper.

307
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,640
That we talk about until we're
blue in the face to everybody,

308
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,270
because there's actually no
way to go back and fix this.

309
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,440
And this is actually one of
the things that,

310
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,940
because there's no, there's no
way to fix this,

311
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,140
this has blown up deals in the
past.

312
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,864
We've, we've seen companies
where, because they haven't

313
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:10,736
filed what's called an 83 b
election deals have blown up.

314
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:13,888
And I'm not going to go into
detail about what that 83 b

315
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,767
election is actually about,
but

316
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,854
just leave it as it affects
your individual taxes, and

317
00:13:18,854 --> 00:13:21,360
it affects the company's
taxes.

318
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,806
And so, it can have a big
impact.

319
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:27,010
So, you know, here we have the
main,

320
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,390
the main things here are sign
the paperwork.

321
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,200
Sign the, sign the stock
purchase agreement,

322
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,920
sign the 83 b election, and
make sure that you

323
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
actually have proof that you
sent that in.

324
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,410
Because if you don't have the
proof,

325
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,770
it just goes into a black hole
at the IRS, and

326
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,540
investors and acquirers will
walk away from a deal if

327
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,430
you can't prove that.

328
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,090
>> Okay.

329
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,653
So the next thing we're going
to talk about is vesting.

330
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:54,983
And I imagine that many of you
are familiar with what

331
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,610
vesting is.

332
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,560
But just in case,

333
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,010
really simply vesting means
that you get full ownership of

334
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,470
your stock over a specific
period of time.

335
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,929
So we're talking about the
stock that Chrissie just said,

336
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,080
you bought your stock of your
company, and

337
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,460
you own it and you get to vote
it.

338
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,610
But if you leave before this
vesting period is over,

339
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,350
then the company can get some
of those unvested shares back.

340
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,400
So and I'm just going to, just
so you guys know the other

341
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,660
ways to refer to vesting,
you'll hear restricted stock.

342
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,360
That means that,

343
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,260
that stock that's subject to
vesting, the IRS speak for

344
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,100
this is, shares that are
subject to forfeiture.

345
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,620
So, so, it's a little
terminology there.

346
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,520
okay.
So,

347
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,480
what should a typical vesting
period be?

348
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,250
In Silicon Valley, the
so-called standard vesting

349
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,090
period is four years with a
one year cliff.

350
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,350
This means that after one
year, the founder vests in or

351
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,840
fully owns, 25% of the shares.

352
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,820
Then the remaining shares vest
monthly over the next

353
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,450
three years.

354
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,390
So here's an example.

355
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,140
Founder buys stock on
Christmas Day, let's say, and

356
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,940
then quits the company on the
following Thanksgiving, so

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
before the year is passed.

358
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,690
In that case, the founder
leaves with zero shares,

359
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,370
right, cliff period hasn't
been met.

360
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,900
If the founder though, quits
the day after the next

361
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,240
Christmas, so a year and a day
later, he or

362
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,770
she's vested in exactly 25% of
the shares, right?

363
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,520
In that case, the one year
cliff has been met.

364
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,116
So, what happens to the shares
when a co,

365
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,280
when a founder stops working
at the company?

366
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,630
Company can repurchase those
shares.

367
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,300
An example I just gave, where
the founder quit, a year and

368
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,790
a day after purchasing the
shares,

369
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,450
75% of those shares are still
invested.

370
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,010
And the company will
repurchase all the,

371
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,590
that full 75% of those shares
from the founder.

372
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,780
How?

373
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,310
Just writes the founder a
check.

374
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,910
That's how the founder bought
it, right?

375
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,660
So, it's the same price per
share that the founder paid,

376
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,270
and it's really just

377
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,760
giving the founder his or her
money back.

378
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,840
So then the question is, why
would you have vesting?

379
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,015
Why would founders do this to
themselves, right?

380
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:03,420
because it's just the founders
they're,

381
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,180
they're doing this on their
own shares.

382
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,100
Doing this to their own
shares.

383
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,830
So, and probably the number
one reason why vesting is

384
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,530
important has to do with
founders leaving the company.

385
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,530
So without, say you didn't
have vesting and

386
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,270
a founder leaves, a huge chunk
of the equity ownership leaves

387
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,300
with a him, him or her.

388
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,740
And obviously that is not fair
to the founders left behind.

389
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,120
And we're actually going to
talk about this a little bit

390
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,020
more when we get to the
founder employment slide,

391
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,750
I'll go into that in more
detail.

392
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,560
But the other reason to have
vesting is the concept of

393
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,840
skin in the game.

394
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,430
The idea that founders need to
be incentivized,

395
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,902
to keep working on their start
up.

396
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,570
If a founder can walk away
with his or

397
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,240
her full ownership at any
point in time, then why would

398
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,010
you stay and grind away, start
ups are hard.

399
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,410
So do single founders need
vesting?

400
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,950
They do, and the reason is
because the skin in the game

401
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,060
concept applies to solo
founders as well.

402
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,320
And investors really want to
see all founders, even

403
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,030
solo founders incentivized to
stay at the company for

404
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,580
a long time.

405
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,770
And the other reason that
single founder should put

406
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,900
vesting on their shares is to
set an example for employees.

407
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,100
Because you can imagine it
would be, you know,

408
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,760
inappropriate for a founder to
tell an employee that he or

409
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,790
she has to have four year
vesting on his or her shares.

410
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,120
But the founder doesn't think
that he or

411
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,490
she needs any on their own
shares.

412
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,370
It's really a culture point.

413
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,860
A founder who has vesting on
his or

414
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,540
her shares, then sets the,
sets the tone for

415
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,420
the company, saying, we're all
in it for the long haul.

416
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,530
We all have vesting on our
shares,

417
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,340
we're doing this together.

418
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,430
So, what are the takeaways
from here?

419
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,140
I would say vesting alliance
incentives among the founders,

420
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,470
if they all have to stick it
out and

421
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,760
grow the company before any of
them get any of that company.

422
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,660
And then number two,

423
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,150
investors don't want to put
money in a company where

424
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,500
the founders can quit whenever
they feel like it and still

425
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,690
have a big equity ownership
stake in that company.

426
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,490
>> Okay, so moving on.

427
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,920
We've now got a beautifully
formed corporation

428
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,800
in Delaware.

429
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,860
Everybody's got their stock.

430
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,530
It's all the, the plain
vanilla standard paperwork.

431
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,850
So, so then what?

432
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,760
You know, probably the next
stage of a company's life

433
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,460
is needing to raise some
money.

434
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,190
So we're going to, we're going
to talk a bit more about that.

435
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,200
And you, and, you know,

436
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,210
we know that you've already
heard a lot from investors and

437
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,780
from founders already in, in
this set of classes.

438
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,430
And they've been talking much
more around the tactics and

439
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,050
how to raise money but, what
about the paperwork?

440
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,990
What about when somebody
actually agrees to

441
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,320
invest, then what?

442
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,010
So, first of all in terms of
logistics,

443
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,960
in very simple terms there are
two ways to raise money.

444
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,000
So, either the price is set
for

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,650
what the, the money that comes
in or the price isn't set.

446
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,380
And by price, we mean the
valuation of the company it's,

447
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,560
it's the same things.

448
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,220
So rounds can't actually be
called anything people can,

449
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,430
can name them whatever they
want.

450
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,852
But generally if you hear the
term,

451
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:07,330
seed round, it would mean that
the price has not been set,

452
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,920
and anything that's a Series A
or a Series B,

453
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
would be something where the
price has been set.

454
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,720
So not setting the price is
the most straightforward,

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,280
fast route to getting money.

456
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,980
And usually the way that this
is done is through convertible

457
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,640
notes or safes.

458
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,050
And, again this is a two way
transaction.

459
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,380
So, there's a piece of paper
that says, for

460
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,290
example, that an investor is
paying $100,000 now.

461
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,350
And in return, has the right
to receive stock at a future

462
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,520
date when the price is set by
investors in a priced round.

463
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,280
So it's important to note that
at, at the time the paper work

464
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,360
is set, that investor is not a
shareholder, and

465
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,260
therefore doesn't have any
voting rights on the company.

466
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,030
They will have some other
rights which Carolynn is

467
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,250
going to talk about
separately.

468
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,810
Of course, investors want
something in return for

469
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,030
putting in money at the
earliest,

470
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,790
ie riskiest, stage of the
companies life.

471
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,580
And this is where the concept
of evaluation cap comes in,

472
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,080
which I'm sure many of you
have heard mentioned before.

473
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,560
So usually the documents for
an un,

474
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,980
unpriced round set a cap for
the conversion into shares.

475
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,750
And that's not the current
valuation of the company

476
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,880
it's actually an upper bound
on the valuation used in

477
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,813
future to use used in future
to calculate how

478
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,442
many shares that investor is
going to get.

479
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,570
So, for an example, an
investor that invests $100,000

480
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,452
on a safe with a $5 million
cap.

481
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:50,428
Then a year later the company
raises a priced round with

482
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:54,546
evaluation of, let's say $20
million.

483
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,403
And then the early investor
would have a much,

484
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,548
much lower price per share,
about a quarter.

485
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:04,650
And therefore that $100,000
would buy them approximately.

486
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,326
Four times more shares than an
investor that was coming in

487
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:12,720
and putting in 100,000 in that
Series A priced round.

488
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,290
So that's where they get
their, their reward for

489
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,030
being in early.

490
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,760
So again, this is another
situation where you need to

491
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,140
make sure you have the signed
documents and you,

492
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,070
you know where they are,

493
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,170
because different investors
may have different rights.

494
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,840
And so you need to know what
those things are.

495
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,710
And again services like Clerky
can, can help with that.

496
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,470
They have very standard
documents that most of

497
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,180
our YC companies use to raise
money on.

498
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,780
A couple of other things to
think about when

499
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,490
you are raising money.

500
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,970
Hopefully you've got a really
hot company that's,

501
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,680
that's doing great and it's
really easy to raise money.

502
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,070
But you should be aware that
all

503
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,020
these people throwing money at
you does have some downsides.

504
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,260
So the first thing is to
understand your

505
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,100
future dilution.

506
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,630
So if you raise, let's say,

507
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,340
$2 million on safes with a
valuation cap of $6 million.

508
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,010
Then when those safes convert
into equity, those early

509
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,110
investors are going to own
about 25% of the company.

510
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,230
And that's going to be in
addition to the investors that

511
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,630
are coming in at that priced
round,

512
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,650
who may want to own 20% of the
company.

513
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,760
So you've already at that
point given away 45% of

514
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,681
the company.

515
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,130
So is this really what you
want?

516
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,310
And, you know, the answer
might be yes.

517
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,740
Remember that some money on a
low valuation cap

518
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,800
is infinitely better than no
money at all.

519
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,240
And if those are the terms
that you can get,

520
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,600
then, then take that money.

521
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,600
But it's just something to be
aware of,

522
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,350
and to follow through the
whole process, so that you can

523
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,220
see where this is going to
lead you down the road.

524
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,940
The other thing to bear in
mind is that the invest,

525
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,340
investors should be
sophisticated.

526
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,460
And by that we mean that they,
they have enough money to be

527
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,230
able to invest and that they,
they understand that

528
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,290
investing in startups is a
risky business.

529
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,140
You know we, we see so many
companies coming into us that

530
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,120
say, oh yeah, my, my uncle put
money in, or my neighbor put

531
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,210
money in, and they've put in
$5 or $10,000 each.

532
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,870
And often, those are the
investors that

533
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,930
cause the most problems going
forward,

534
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,090
because they don't understand
how this is a long term game.

535
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,321
And so, you know, they get to
the point where they're

536
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:37,482
sitting, thinking hm, I could
actually do with that

537
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,889
money back because I need a
new kitchen.

538
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:40,909
Or, you know this,

539
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:43,610
this startup investing is not
actually as exciting as

540
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,430
all the TV shows and movies
made it out to be.

541
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,578
So, and those, those cause
problems to the company,

542
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:51,114
you know, if they're, they're
asking for their money back.

543
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,850
So, just be aware that, that
you should really be

544
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,719
getting money from people who
are sophisticated and

545
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,233
know what they're doing.

546
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,316
And the term that you'll hear
that, that refers to

547
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,620
these people are that they are
accredited investors.

548
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,570
So really the main,

549
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,920
the main points here is keep
it simple, raise your

550
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,790
money using standard documents
keep, make sure that you have
