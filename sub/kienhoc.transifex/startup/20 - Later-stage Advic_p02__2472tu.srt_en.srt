301
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,520
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ZQ-rf6iIc
founders usually understand
this is good,

302
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,160
investors are very
shortsighted and

303
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
don't want to dilute
themselves.

304
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,690
So they'll like fight you over
every equity grant.

305
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,850
But we've seen a lot of data
at YC now,

306
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,980
and the most successful
companies, and

307
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,720
the ones where the investors
do the best,

308
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
end up giving a lot of stock
out to employees,

309
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,630
year after year after year.

310
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,870
So I tell founders like, you
should think about,

311
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,580
you know, for the next ten
years, you're going to

312
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,440
be giving out 3 to 5% of the
company every year,

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,380
because you just get bigger
and bigger.

314
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,790
So the individual grants get
smaller, but in aggregate,

315
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,490
it's a lot of stock.

316
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,050
And I think this is really
important to do,

317
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,300
if you value your people, you
should be doing this.

318
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,360
specifically, you need to do
this with refresher grants and

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,550
you should get a, a plan in
place for this early.

320
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,770
You know, I think, you never
want an employee in a place

321
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,350
where they vested three out of
their four years of stock and

322
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,320
they start thinking about
leaving.

323
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
So you should always stay in
front of

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,710
people's vesting schedules.

325
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,210
And you know, how they plan
early where you have

326
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,120
refresher grants in place.

327
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,680
There are a lot of new
structures that people have

328
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,750
been using here.

329
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,230
I personally like six year,
big grants, but

330
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,730
six years investing.

331
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,500
because I think these
companies just take

332
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,250
a while to build.

333
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,120
There's Pyramid Vesting where
you back weight

334
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,020
someone's grant, so in year
four they get a lot more of

335
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,000
the vesting than year one.

336
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,040
There's a concept, different
names for it,

337
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,850
but something like continuous
forward vesting,

338
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,780
where people's grants are
automatically reupped

339
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,090
every year, at the same number
of shares.

340
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,270
Whatever you decide, get an
option management system

341
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,360
in place at about this point.

342
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,230
The normal way people do

343
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,040
this is just someone keeps an
Excel spreadsheet.

344
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,990
I have seen mistakes that have
cost employees or

345
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,730
companies tens of

346
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,920
millions of dollars because
they didn't get this right.

347
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,190
So there's really good option
management systems or

348
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,050
software and

349
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,740
you should get those in place
around this point.

350
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,730
The other sort of HR stuff to
touch on, there are a bunch of

351
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,250
rules that change around 50
employees.

352
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,360
Common examples are that you
have to

353
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,110
start sexual harassment
training and

354
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,780
diversity training there's a
bunch of others as well.

355
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,880
But just put a little pin in
your mind that when you

356
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,750
cross 50 employees there's a
new set of HR rules that you

357
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,520
have to comply with.

358
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,110
Monitor your team for burnout.

359
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,371
Again, it's up to product
market fit it's just to

360
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:39,390
Sprint, now it becomes a
marathon.

361
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,860
At this point, you actually
don't want people to

362
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,410
work a hundred hours a week
forever.

363
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,860
You want them to go on
vacation.

364
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,840
You want them to have new
challenges and do new things.

365
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,680
And if you let the whole
company get burned out all at

366
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,380
once, that, that is often a
company-ending thing.

367
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,140
This is also a good time to
put in place a,

368
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,000
a hiring process.

369
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,550
Another thing that most
founders regret is they

370
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,590
don't hire as soon as
everything is working,

371
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,320
I think you should hire a
full-time recruiter.

372
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,660
If you do this too early,

373
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,540
that's bad because you'll hire
too fast, and

374
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,890
that usually implodes.

375
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,770
But, most founders get behind
the ball on this.

376
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,840
The other, there are a lot of
other,

377
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,250
sort of just hiring process
tips.

378
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,900
For example, I think most
companies,

379
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,790
even until they get up to say
3 or 400 employees

380
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,280
should announce every offer on
some internal mailing list or

381
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,631
something before they make it,

382
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,210
because like half the time you
do that,

383
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,830
someone in the company will
know something good or

384
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,750
bad about that employee.

385
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,090
And the companies that I

386
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,430
know that have instituted this
have been really happy.

387
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,820
Also a good time to have a
program in place to ramp up

388
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,230
employees, so when someone
starts, you know,

389
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,940
what does their first week
look like?

390
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,520
How do they get, how do they
get spun up?

391
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,920
How do they learn everything
they need to learn?

392
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,820
Are they going to have

393
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
a buddy that's going to think
through them?

394
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,030
That's going to help them
think through kind of

395
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,910
everything about the company.

396
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,660
Here's one that you actually
do need to think about before

397
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,660
the 12 to 24 month mark, which
is diversity on the team ,.

398
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,610
The most common place this
comes up honestly is people

399
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,730
that hire, you know, all guys
on their engineering team for

400
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,891
the first 15 or 20 people.

401
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,940
And in that point you get a
culture in place that sort of

402
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,470
takes on a life of it's own,
and most founders that I've

403
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,620
spoken to that have made this
mistake regret it and

404
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,520
they wished they had hired
some diversity of

405
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,000
perspective on the team early
on.

406
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,770
Engineering teams are not the
only place where it comes up,

407
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,700
but that's where you see it
the most often, and

408
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,550
if you get this right early
you'll be able to grow

409
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,660
the team much more quickly
over, over the long-term.

410
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,220
The other thing to

411
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,110
think about is what happens to
your early employees.

412
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,710
So, a common situation that
happens is,

413
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,640
the company evolves fast the
early employees

414
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,910
you know, the company, so like
you hire an engineer who is

415
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,900
a really great engineer, but
then as the engineering team

416
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,180
grows you need a VP of
Engineering.

417
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,680
The early engineer wants to be
the VP of Engineering,

418
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,940
you can't do that, and but you
don't the early employee to

419
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
leave, they're an important,
important part of the culture,

420
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,570
they know a lot, people love
them, and so

421
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,930
I think you want to be very
proactive about this.

422
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,100
You know, you want to like
think about what's the path

423
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,770
for my first 10 or 15
employees going to

424
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,240
be as the company grows, and
then just talk to them about

425
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,970
it very directly, be up front,
you know,.

426
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,295
I want, like sit them down and

427
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,574
say, I want to talk about,
sort of where you want to see

428
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,326
your career go inside of this
company.

429
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,178
All right, so

430
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:30,083
company productivity, this is
something you don't need to

431
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:33,491
think about in the early days
because small teams are just

432
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,632
sort of naturally productive
most of the time.

433
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:37,671
But as you grow,

434
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:41,383
it the productivity I think
goes down with the square of

435
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:45,097
the number of employees if you
don't make an effort because

436
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:48,586
it sort of one of these like
connections between nodes,

437
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:51,880
every pair of people adds
communication overhead.

438
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,950
And so if you don't start
thinking about the systems

439
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,550
that you're going to put in
place, when the company is 25

440
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,610
to 50 people, to stay
productive as you grow

441
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,460
things will grind to a halt
faster than you can imagine.

442
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,690
The single word that matters
most, I think,

443
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,780
to keep the company productive
as it grows is alignment ,.

444
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,940
The reason companies become
unproductive is

445
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,620
people are either not on the
same page and you know, don't

446
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,320
know what the same priorities
are, or they're actively

447
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,900
working against each other
which is obviously worse.

448
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,870
But if you can keep the entire
company aligned in

449
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,490
the same direction, you'll
have one well over half of

450
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,540
the battle, and, and the way
to

451
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,250
start with this is just a very
clear roadmap and goals.

452
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,010
Everyone in the company should
know what the roadmap for

453
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,000
the next three or six months,
or a year, depending on

454
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,560
where the company is in its
life cycle, looks like.

455
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,760
You know, a classic test that
I love to give is if

456
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,520
I walk into a company getting,
beginning to struggle with

457
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,330
these scaling issues, I'll ask
the founders, like,

458
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,130
if I walked around and polled
ten random employees and

459
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,070
asked them what the top three
goals for the company are,

460
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,678
right now, would they all say
the same thing?

461
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:04,360
And a 100% of the time, the
founder says, yes,

462
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,940
of course they would, and I'd
go do it, and 100%

463
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,600
of the time, no two employees
even say the same three,

464
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,570
top three goals, in order.

465
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,600
And founders can never believe
it, because they're like well

466
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,650
I announced that in all hands
like three months ago what our

467
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,190
goals were going to be, and
how can they not remember?

468
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,710
But it's really important to
keep reiterating the,

469
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,990
the message about the roadmap
and

470
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,210
the goals, and almost no
founder does this enough.

471
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,290
And if you do it, you know the
company will say, you know,

472
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,600
all right, these are our
goals, we understand them,

473
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,235
we're going to get them done,

474
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:37,010
I know self-organize around
that.

475
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,400
But if people don't know what
the roadmap of

476
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
their goals are it won't
happen.

477
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,340
We already talked about
figuring out your

478
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,280
values early, but

479
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,240
I want to reiterate that
because that also really help

480
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,600
the company make the right
decisions.

481
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,350
If everyone knows what the
framework to decide is.

482
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,165
They'll make hopeful the same
decisions if

483
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,200
they're smart people.

484
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,020
You want to continue to be run
by great products and

485
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,520
not process for its own sake,
this is a fine, fine line.

486
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,340
Because you do need to put
some process in place, but

487
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,100
you never want to put process
in

488
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,310
place that rewards the
process.

489
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,200
The focus has to always be on
great product.

490
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,900
One easy way to do this that a
lot of companies try is they

491
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,510
just say, we're going to ship
something every day, and

492
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,610
if you do that you know,

493
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,500
there's at least a continued
focus on delivery.

494
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,520
And then transparency and
rhythm in how you communicate

495
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,330
are really important, most
founders wait way too long on

496
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,980
these, but having a management
meeting every week,

497
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,160
of just the people that report
directly to the founder or

498
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,220
the CEO, critical ,.

499
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,050
All hands meetings not quite
sure how often is optimal for

500
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,250
those, at least once a month
where you go through

501
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,900
the results and

502
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,090
the real map with the entire
company really important.

503
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,300
And then, you know, doing a
plan every quarter of

504
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,990
what we're going to get down
over the next three months and

505
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,010
how that fits into our goals
for

506
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,830
the year, also becomes really
important.

507
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,620
I put offsites up there,

508
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,310
because I don't think people
do these nearly enough.

509
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,280
A surprising number of the
successful companies we've

510
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,860
been involved with do a lot of
offsites.

511
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,660
Where they'll take their best
people for a weekend to

512
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,690
a cabin in the woods or
somewhere and just talk about.

513
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,680
What do we want to be when we
grow up?

514
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,410
What are our most important
things to be doing?

515
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,420
What are we not doing that we
should be doing?

516
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,670
But get people out of the
office and

517
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,710
out of the day-to-day,
everyone I

518
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,990
know that does those thinks
they're well worth the time.

519
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,120
So the goal in all of this
productivity planning is that

520
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,870
you're trying to build a
company that creates a lot of

521
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,320
value over a long period of
time,

522
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,070
and the long period of time is
what's important here.

523
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,443
You can avoid all of this and

524
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,832
just like with the authority
of the founder make

525
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:42,114
sure the company ships a great
next version.

526
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:44,438
But that won't work for
version ten, it won't work for

527
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:45,390
version 11.

528
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,824
I, I really believe that this
single hardest thing in

529
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:52,183
business is building a company
that does repeatable

530
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,176
innovation and

531
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:56,858
just has this ongoing culture
of excellence as it grows.

532
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:01,665
If you look at the examples of
this most companies fail here.

533
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:05,202
Most companies do one great
thing where the founder just

534
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,007
pushes to get it done and

535
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:11,030
then don't innovate that well
on follow on products.

536
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,900
And it really takes founders
that think about how I'm

537
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,970
going to do this second thing.

538
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,650
This really hard thing.

539
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,380
To get something like an Apple
that can churn out great

540
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,850
products for 30 or 40 years,
or longer.

541
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,050
All right, these are super
tactical mechanics.

542
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,230
This is, this is definitely to
just put on a list and

543
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,380
remember these things for
later.

544
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,320
All right in the early days,

545
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,910
people basically ignore all
accounting and they have,

546
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,100
like, maybe if they're lucky,
a shoebox full of receipts.

547
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,010
They certainly don't have
anything that

548
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,100
looks like a financial report.

549
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,900
This is a good time to get it
in place.

550
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,580
You know, when things are
working, say,

551
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,090
month 18 or whatever.

552
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,410
You can do this with an
outsourced person.

553
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,420
Just say, you know what?

554
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,720
We want, like to get our books
in order.

555
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,790
We want to start getting
audits every year.

556
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,590
We want to

557
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,890
start a relationship with an
accounting firm.

558
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,710
Easy to do.

559
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,360
Definitely worth it.

560
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,670
This is also a good time to
collect your legal documents.

561
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,410
Because it's easy to fix
things now.

562
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,010
So, if you actually assign
someone to go through and

563
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,270
collect every agreement the
company has ever signed.

564
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,930
Then when your landlord tries
to **** you out of your

565
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,360
lease and no-one can find the
lease which happens like,

566
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,640
half the time somehow someone
will be able to find it.

567
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,840
Also, you're almost certainly
missing something.

568
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,470
Some employee didn't sign
their PIIA or

569
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,410
whatever and you'll find it
now.

570
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,840
It's easy to fix now.

571
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,270
It gets really hard to fix,
like,

572
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,350
in the middle of your next
round of financing.

573
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,230
So, again, this is time to
bring, like,

574
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,790
a little bit of the order to,
to chaos.

575
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,150
FF stock is a special class of
stock for

576
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,210
founders that the founders can
sell in a later round,

577
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,090
without messing up the
common-stock valuation.

578
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,880
It used to be that most people
set this up

579
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,680
right when they started the
company.

580
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,690
Founders fund sort of
popularizes.

581
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,410
Which is why it's called FF
stock.

582
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,750
But it became a really bad
signal, right?

583
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,230
Founders that were obsessed
with their own

584
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,840
personal liquidity when the
company had nothing turned out

585
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,710
to like fail most of the time.

586
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,700
And so investors learn that if
founders pushed on this in

587
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,110
the seed round it was a very,
very bad sign.

588
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,150
Most founders don't actually
want to sell stock until

589
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,460
the company is worth, like a
billion dollars or

590
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,680
something like that.

591
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,867
So, I think you can actually
safely set this up after

592
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:21,454
things start working, in the
next financial round, and then

593
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:24,260
you can sell it two, three,
four years down the road.

594
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,050
But it's a good thing to

595
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,930
remember by about the time you
get to the B round.

596
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,480
IP, trademarks and patents.

597
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,090
actually, just IP and
trademarks.

598
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,370
So, you have 12 months,

599
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,610
after you announce something,
if you want to patent it.

600
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,280
And, if you miss that window,
it's very hard to do.
