802
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,920
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFX95HahaUs
A big reason for that is so

803
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,040
we can fix our mistakes and
we can pay up to get in

804
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,140
later when we screw up early
on.

805
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,220
The other thing i'll
highlight though

806
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,770
is the other reason why we
pull the trigger at

807
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,480
a high evaluation, when we
did was because of our,

808
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,810
we had spent time at the
point with the founders.

809
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,210
With Brian and with Joe and
Nate and there's a friend of

810
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,750
mine in private equity has
this great line,

811
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,058
Egon Durban has this great
line.

812
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,930
He says when people progress
through their careers,

813
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,940
they get bigger and bigger
jobs, and

814
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,450
at some point they get the
really big job.

815
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,240
And it's,

816
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,610
some people, half people
grow into the big job, and

817
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:10,380
about the other half of
people swell into it.

818
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,920
Right?
And you can

819
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
kinda tell the difference.

820
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,510
There's a point where people
just lose their minds.

821
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,770
And one of the issues with
these companies that

822
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,860
are sort of super successful
hyper growth companies is

823
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,960
you know, this would be the
sorta the classic case.

824
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,910
These super young founders
who

825
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,290
haven't run anything before,
so how are they gonna be at

826
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,030
running this sorta giant
global operation, and

827
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,770
we just were tremendously
impressed and our, today,

828
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,030
every time we deal with all
three of those guys.

829
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,940
How mature they are, how
much they are progressing.

830
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,620
You know, it, it's like they
get more and

831
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,500
more mature, they get better
and better adjustment and

832
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,940
they get more and more
humble as they grow.

833
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,590
And so that made us feel
really good.

834
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,310
That not just was this
business gonna grow, but

835
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,430
that these were guys who
were gonna be

836
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,430
able to build something.

837
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,420
And be able to run it in a
really good way.

838
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,350
>> You know, people always
ask me.

839
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,460
Why do you think Airbnb is
such a great company.

840
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,330
It's funny we're obsessing
over Airbnb but and

841
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,620
I say to people it's because
all three founders are as

842
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,280
good as the other founder.

843
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,180
That is very rare.

844
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,120
In the case of Google.

845
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,960
Two founders,

846
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,605
one of them is a little
better than the other one.

847
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:15,180
>> [LAUGHTER}

848
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,900
>> Hey, he is the CEO every
company has a CEO.

849
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,620
>> I think we just got the
tech crunch headline.

850
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,040
>> Every company, every
company has a CEO.

851
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,010
Why am I saying this?

852
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,410
>> When you start a company,

853
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,050
you have to go find somebody
as good or better than you.

854
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,524
To be the cofounder.

855
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,300
If you do that,

856
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,710
your chances of success grow
astronomically.

857
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,570
And that's why Airbnb became
so successful, so quickly.

858
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,470
The anomaly is Mark
Zuckerberg at Facebook.

859
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,690
Yes, he has an awesome team.

860
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,000
But the Mark Zuckerberg
phenomenon where it's

861
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,045
mainly one person, that is
the outlier.

862
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,380
>> Hm-mm.

863
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,930
>> So when you start a
company you have got to find

864
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,370
phenomenal co-founders.

865
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,080
>> All right.
Audience questions.

866
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,060
Yes.

867
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,140
>> So obviously the
conventional wisdom about

868
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,000
why you raise money is
because you need it.

869
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:19,252
But the more I get off
conventional wisdom the more

870
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:22,171
I'm starting to hear another
story about why you

871
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:25,589
raise money and I"m actually
hearing founders say it's

872
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,720
more to facilitate the big
exit, or in the worst case

873
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,170
to facilitate the acqui hire
that are just fizzling out.

874
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,190
What extent is that accurate
thinking or

875
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,596
>> Does raising money help

876
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,710
you with an exit, or an
acqui hire?

877
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,190
>> Well if you,

878
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,680
if you pick good investors
who have good Rolodexes and

879
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,259
domain expertise in what
your company does.

880
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,010
They're gonna add a lot more
value than the money.

881
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,110
And those are the types of
investors you should be

882
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,720
looking for.

883
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,220
>> Yeah.
>> So the answer to

884
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,410
the question is clearly yes.

885
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,810
But also in a sense it
doesn't matter.

886
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,280
Cuz you can't plan these
things according to

887
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,210
the downside.

888
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,880
And so.

889
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,510
I mean, that's the scenario
you are not

890
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,520
are obviously not hoping
for.

891
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,030
And so while the answer is
yes.

892
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,140
Probably that shouldn't
enter into

893
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,560
the decision making process.

894
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,660
Too much, but it might enter
into which investor to

895
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,360
raise money from,

896
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,770
it probably doesn't enter
into the whether to

897
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,720
raise money question that
much I don't think.

898
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,170
>> I intend to start a
business,

899
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,240
just grow the capital
investment,

900
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,260
I do want to end up with
some equity.

901
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,850
Do you guys have any advice
about how to

902
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,470
deal with extra amounts,
people are taking so

903
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,760
long, not everything is like
software.

904
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,640
It's viral.

905
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,340
What should congress do for

906
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,520
capital investment companies
>> So this is,

907
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,170
I would double down on my
previous comments on

908
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,910
the onion theory of risk and
the staging of risk in cash

909
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,930
which is the more capital
has in the business the more

910
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,010
intense and serious you have
to be about exactly what's

911
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,510
going to be required to make
the business work and

912
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,350
what the staging of
milestones and risks are.

913
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,660
Cuz in that case, you wanna
line up,

914
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,700
you wanna be very precise of
lining up.

915
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,900
Because the risk is so

916
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,070
high that it'll all go
sideways right?

917
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,120
So, like, you wanna be very
precise what you're

918
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,320
gonna accomplish with your A
round.

919
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,950
And what's going to be

920
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,280
a successful execution of
the A round.

921
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,520
Because if you raise too
much money in the A round,

922
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,150
that'll seriously screw you
up, right,

923
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,920
later on down the road.

924
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,480
In the, cuz you know you're
gonna raise the C,

925
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,400
D, E rounds.

926
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,830
You know, and then the
cumulative,

927
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,560
dilution will get to be,
will get to be too much.

928
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,960
And so you have to be
precise on

929
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,860
every single round.

930
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,060
You have to raise as close
to the exact right amount of

931
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,360
money as possible and then
you have to be as pure and

932
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,860
clean and, and precise with
the investors as you

933
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,460
can possibly be about the
risks and the milestones.

934
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,120
But, this by the way is a
big thing.

935
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,720
This is actually, I'm really
glad you asked the question.

936
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,250
It kind of goes back to what
Parker said.

937
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,820
Like, look if you walk into
our firm and

938
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,250
you've got Twitter, or
you've got Pinterest,

939
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,820
you've got something and
it's just viral growth and

940
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,770
it's just on fire and it's
just gonna go.

941
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,960
Like, those are the easy
ones.

942
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,150
Like it's just, like, let's
put money in it.

943
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,890
And let's just feed the
beast and off it goes.

944
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,670
But if you walk in and

945
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,170
you're like, I got this
really great idea.

946
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,880
But it's gonna take $300
million,

947
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,270
staged out over the next
five years.

948
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,670
Probably across five rounds.

949
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,650
You know, It has

950
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,790
a potentially very big
outcome.

951
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,760
But boy, like this is not
Twitter.

952
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,710
Like, this is gonna be
serious heavy lifting.

953
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,880
To be able to get there.

954
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,940
We will still do those but
the operational excellence

955
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,620
of the part of the team
matters a lot more.

956
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,310
And one of the ways that you
can convey the operational

957
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,465
excellence is in the quality
of the plant.

958
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:14,370
And back to the Steve Martin
thing be so

959
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,490
good they can't ignore you.

960
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,670
The plans should be very
precise.

961
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,580
>> And there are ways if
your capital equipment.

962
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,230
Intensive.

963
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,560
There are ways of borrowing
money in addition to

964
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,270
venture capital.

965
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:26,950
>> Yeah.
>> Sorry.

966
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,938
>> You, you can kick in.

967
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:29,050
You can kick on a venture
data and

968
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,070
then later on lease
financing.

969
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,792
But again that underlines
the need for operational

970
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,755
excellence because if you're
gonna raise debt, then you

971
00:36:33,755 --> 00:36:35,478
really need to be precise in
how you're running the

972
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,321
company because it's very
easy to trip the convenance

973
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,820
on a loan and it's very easy
to lose the company.

974
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,340
And so it's a thread the
needle progress that

975
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,170
demands a just sort of a
more advanced level of

976
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,280
management then sort of, you
know, the next SnapChat.

977
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,670
>> What are some bad sides
for

978
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,130
investors that you shouldn't
work with their company?

979
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,580
>> Yeah that's a good
question.

980
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,420
How do you know with an,
what's a sign that you

981
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,079
should avoid a particular
investor?

982
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,800
>> Well, it's the inverse of
what I

983
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,570
said about a good investor.

984
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,650
If it's an investor who has
no domain expertise in your

985
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,650
company, does not have a
Rolodex where they can

986
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,920
help you with introductions.

987
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,040
Both for business
development and

988
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,130
in helping you do the
intro's for series a.

989
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,440
And you should not take that
person's money,

990
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,290
especially if they're in it
just to make money and you

991
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,030
can suss those people out,
you know, pretty quickly.

992
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,420
>> Yeah I would, glad you
asked that question.

993
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,980
Bring up sort of a broader
point which is

994
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,690
If your company is
successful.

995
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,730
You know, we're talking
about our,

996
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:37,510
you know, I think,

997
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,220
generally, or at least as a
company, is we want,

998
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,829
our investors are the ones
that wanna build big,

999
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:42,180
independent franchise
companies.

1000
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,170
So we're talking about a 10
or 15 or 20 year journey.

1001
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,760
You know, 10 or 15 or 20
years you may

1002
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,590
notice is longer than the
average American marriage.

1003
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:53,520
>> This is significant.

1004
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,930
The choice of key investors,
of particular investors who

1005
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,460
are gonna be on the board
for a company, I think,

1006
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,180
is just as important as who
you get married to,

1007
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,259
which is extremely
important.

1008
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,940
These are people you're
gonna be living with, and

1009
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,690
partnering with and

1010
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,770
relying on, and dealing with
in position, you know,

1011
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,460
in conditions of great
stress and

1012
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,420
anxiety for a long period of
time.

1013
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,349
And the big argument I
always make is, and

1014
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,894
ours like make this all the
time,

1015
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:16,560
sometimes people believe it
and sometimes they don't.

1016
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,260
Which is like if everything
just goes great,

1017
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,730
it kind of doesn't matter
who investors are,.

1018
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,600
But almost never does
everything just go great.

1019
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,820
Right?
Even the big successful

1020
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,680
companies even the big you
know, Facebook and all these

1021
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,050
big companies that are now
considered very successful.

1022
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,320
You know, along the way all
kinds of shit went,

1023
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,130
you know, shit hit the fan
over and over and

1024
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,870
over and over again.

1025
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,270
And there are any number of
stressful board meetings and

1026
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,840
discussions and

1027
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,440
late night meetings with the
future of the company at

1028
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,290
stake where everybody really
has to be on the same team.

1029
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,280
And have the same goals and

1030
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,370
be pulling in the same
direction and

1031
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,740
have a shared understanding.

1032
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,590
That have the right kind of
ethics and the right kind of

1033
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,560
staying power, you know, to
be able to actually weather

1034
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,380
the storms that come up.

1035
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,790
And one of the things that
you'll find that is a big

1036
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,450
difference between first
time founders versus second

1037
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,560
time founders is almost
always second time

1038
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,740
founders take that point
much more seriously.

1039
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,220
After they've been through
it once, and so

1040
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,820
it really, really, really
matters.

1041
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,630
I always thought, and I
believe that it does.

1042
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,050
It really matters who your
partner is, it really is

1043
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,830
like getting married, and it
is worth putting the same

1044
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,070
amount of time, maybe not
quite as much time and

1045
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,020
effort into picking your
spouse, but

1046
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,190
it is worth spending
significant time really

1047
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,250
understanding who you're
about to be partnered with.

1048
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,180
>> Yeah,
>> Because that's way

1049
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,390
more important than.

1050
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,840
You know, did I get another
$5 million in

1051
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,100
the valuation or did, you
know,

1052
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,654
did I get another $2 million
in the check?

1053
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,470
>> The marriage analogy is
great.

1054
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,860
I know at SV Angel, our
attitude is when we

1055
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,650
invest in an entrepreneur,
we are investing for life.

1056
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,420
Because we wanna invest in,
if we made the right

1057
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,690
decision, we're gonna invest
in every company they start.

1058
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,020
And, once an entrepreneur,
always an entrepreneur.

1059
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,890
So we actually do consider
it a marriage.

1060
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,190
We're, investing for life.

1061
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,470
>> One thing that I,

1062
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,570
that, which is another of
saying what Mark just said,

1063
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,412
is I always look for.

1064
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:56,741
In that first meeting,

1065
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,430
do you feel like you respect
this person?

1066
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,470
And do you feel like

1067
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,820
you have a lot to learn from
them?

1068
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:08,213
Cuz sometimes you walk in
and they have this like just
