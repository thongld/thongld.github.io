00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,530
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfnkM44Urs
Uh, before I jump into
today's lecture,

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,120
I wanted to answer a few
questions.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,050
People emailed me saying
they had questions about

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,830
the last lecture they ran
out of time for.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,290
So if you have a question
about what we

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,480
covered last time um,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,670
I am welcome to answer it
now starting with you.

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,290
>> Can you use the mic feed?

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,560
>> Uh, it should be on.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,320
Can you not hear me?

11
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:21,543
No?

12
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,439
Maybe you can ask them to
turn on.

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,192
Ah, hopefully it will come
on.

14
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,030
Anybody else?

15
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,898
Yes?

16
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,827
>> Ah, so one question that
was submitted online was um,

17
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,481
how do I identify if a
market has

18
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:40,150
a fast growth rate now, and
also for the next ten years.

19
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,060
>> All right, so the
question is

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,088
how you identify markets
that are growing quickly.

21
00:00:43,088 --> 00:00:45,830
Um, the good news about this
is is this is one of the big

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,430
advantages students have.

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,880
Um, you should just trust
your instincts on this.

24
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,150
Um, older people have to
basically guess about

25
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,020
the technologies that are
sort of,

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,930
that young people are using,
right?

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,810
Because young people get
older and

28
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,350
they become the dominant
market.

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,440
Um, but you can just watch
what you're doing,

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,650
what your friends are doing.

31
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,770
And um,

32
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,185
you will almost certainly
have better instincts on

33
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,700
fast-growing markets than
anybody older than you.

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,900
And so the answer to this is
just trust your instincts.

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,080
Think about what you're
using more,

36
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,840
think about what you're
using, what you're

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,870
seeing people your age begin
to start using.

38
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,350
Um, that will almost
certainly be the future.

39
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,450
Maybe I can do one more
question on

40
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,450
the last lecture before we
start.

41
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,110
>> Um, this isn't really
last lecture, but

42
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,260
another online is, how do
you deal with burnout while

43
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,910
still being effective and
remaining effective?

44
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,840
>> Yeah.
Sure.

45
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,900
Um, so the question is

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,830
how you deal with burnout as
a founder.

47
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,650
Uh, this, the answer to this
is just that it sucks and

48
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,700
you keep going.

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,340
Um, unlike a student, where
you can sort of throw up

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,870
your hands and say, you know
what, I'm really burned out.

51
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm just gonna like get bad
grades this quarter.

52
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,750
Uh, one of the hard parts
about running a start up

53
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,060
is that it's real life.

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,420
And um, you just have to get
through it.

55
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,080
Uh, the canonical advice is
like go

56
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,390
on vacation or whatever.

57
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,140
Um, that never works for
founders.

58
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,285
It's sort of all consuming
in this way.

59
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:04,380
It's very difficult to
understand.

60
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,190
So what you do is you just
keep going.

61
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,160
Um, you rely on people uh,
it's like really important.

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
And founder depression is
this serious thing.

63
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,180
And you need to have a
support network.

64
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,670
Um, but the way through
burnout is just to address

65
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,140
the challenges, address the
things that are going wrong,

66
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,702
and you'll eventually feel
better.

67
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:24,800
All right, so, last week we,
or last lecture we

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,850
covered the idea and the
product, um, and I want to

69
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,030
just emphasize that if you
don't get those right,

70
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,360
none of the rest of this
going to save you.

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,550
Um, today, we're gonna talk
about how to hire ah, and

72
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,130
how to execute.

73
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,000
Hopefully you don't execute
the people you hire.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,500
Um.

75
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,212
Sometimes.

76
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:47,130
Uh, so, first, I wanna talk
about co-founder.

77
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,970
Um, co-founder relationships
are among the most

78
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,840
important in the entire
company.

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,450
Um, and everyone says that
you need to watch out for

80
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,200
tension brewing among
co-founders, and

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,180
address them immediately,
and that's all true.

82
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,330
And certainly in YC's case.

83
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,630
The number one cause of
early death for

84
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,549
start ups is, is co-founder
blow ups.

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,125
But for some reason a lot of
treat choosing their

86
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,710
co-founder with even less
importance than

87
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,500
they put on hiring.

88
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,060
Um, don't do this.

89
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,660
This is one of the most
important decisions you

90
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,400
make in the life of your
start up,

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,450
and you get treated as such.

92
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,750
And for some reason,

93
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,460
students are really bad at
this.

94
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,150
They just pick someone,

95
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,250
they're like I wanna start a
business,

96
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,420
you wanna start a business,
let's start it,

97
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,450
start it together.

98
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,760
Um, there are these, like,
co-founder dating things

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,900
where you're like hey, I'm
looking for a co-founder.

100
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
We don't really know each
other,

101
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,400
let's start a company.

102
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,550
And this is like crazy.

103
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,700
Um, you would never hire
someone like this, and yet

104
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,330
people are willing to

105
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,780
choose their business
partners this way.

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,230
Um, it's really, really bad.

107
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,860
And choosing a random
co-founder or

108
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,070
choosing someone you don't
have a long history with.

109
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,580
Choosing someone that you're
not friends with.

110
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,130
So that when things are
really going wrong, you have

111
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,560
this sort of past history to
bind you together.

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,100
Um, usually ends up in
disaster.

113
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,404
We had one YC batch where
nine of about 75 companies

114
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:04,090
added on a random co-founder
between when we

115
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,510
interviewed the companies
and when they started,

116
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,070
and all nine of those teams
fell apart in the next year.

117
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,579
Uh, the track record for
founders that

118
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,370
don't already know each
other is really bad.

119
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,840
Um, a good way to meet a
co-founder is in college.

120
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,760
If you're not in college and

121
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,920
you don't know a co-founder,
the next best thing I

122
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,485
think is to go work in an
interesting company.

123
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,985
If you work at Facebook or
Google or

124
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,175
something like that, um,

125
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:26,680
it's probably almost as
co-founder Rich at Stanford.

126
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,490
It's better to have no
co-founder uh,

127
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,120
than have a bad co-founder,
but

128
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,920
it's still bad to be a solo
founder.

129
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
Um, I was just looking at

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,586
the stats here before we
started.

131
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,920
For the top, and

132
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,690
I may have missed one cause
I was counting quickly, but

133
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,700
I think, but for the top 20
most valuable YC

134
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,500
companies um, all of them
have at least two founders.

135
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,437
Uh, and we, we probably fund
at a rate of something like

136
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,640
one out of ten solo teams.

137
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,813
Uh, so best of all,

138
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:55,880
founder you know, co-founder
you know.

139
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,440
Um, better than that or not
as good as that but

140
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,220
still okay, solo founder.

141
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,580
Random founder you meet.

142
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,820
Uh, again students do this
for some reason.

143
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,460
Really, really bad.

144
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,080
Uh, so as you're thinking
about co-founders and

145
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,800
people that could be good,

146
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,930
there's a question of what
you're looking for, right?

147
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,350
And at YC we have this
public phrase.

148
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,220
Um, and it's relentlessly
resourceful.

149
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,030
And everyone's heard about
it.

150
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,950
And I think that really is a
very good description for

151
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,840
what you're looking for with
co-founders.

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,270
Um, you definitely need

153
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,646
relentlessly resourceful
co-founders.

154
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,970
Um, but there's a more
colorful example that we

155
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,090
share at the YC kickoff.

156
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,220
Um, Paul Gram started using
this, and

157
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,110
I've kept it going.

158
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,057
Um, so you're looking for

159
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:39,070
co-founders that need to be
unflappable, tough.

160
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,030
They know what to do in
every situation.

161
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,690
They act quickly.

162
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,470
They're decisive.

163
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,220
They're creative.

164
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,820
They're ready for anything.

165
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,890
Um, and it turns out that
there's a model for

166
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,960
this in, in pop culture.

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,950
And it sounds really dumb,
but

168
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,240
it's at least very
memorable.

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,110
And we've told every class
of YC this for

170
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,110
a long time, and I think it
helps them.

171
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,300
Um, and that model is James
Bond.

172
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,790
Um, and again it sounds
crazy but it, it, uh,

173
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,790
it will at least stick in
your memory and, and

174
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,620
you need someone that
behaves like James Bond

175
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,480
more than you need someone
that is you

176
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,870
know an expert in some
particular domain.

177
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,160
As I mentioned earlier,

178
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,930
you really want to know your
co-founders for

179
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,140
a while, ideally years.

180
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,100
This is true for early hires
as well.

181
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,200
But incidentally, more
people get this right for

182
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,689
early hires, than they do
for co-founders.

183
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,470
Uh, so again, take advantage
of school.

184
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,060
Um, in addition to
relentlessly resourceful,

185
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,820
you want a tough and a calm
co-founder.

186
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,060
Uh, there are all the
obvious things like smart.

187
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,590
But everyone knows that you
want a smart co-founder.

188
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,330
Uh, most people don't
prioritize tough and

189
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,020
calm well enough.

190
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,300
Especially if you feel like
you yourself aren't,

191
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
you need a co-founder who
is.

192
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,510
Um, if you're not technical,
and

193
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,570
hopefully most people in
this room are,

194
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,940
you really want a technical
co-founder.

195
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,012
There's this weird thing
going on in

196
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,215
start ups right now where
it's become popular to say,

197
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,330
like you know what?

198
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,590
We don't need technical
founders,

199
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,330
we're gonna hire people,

200
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,420
We're just gonna be great
managers.

201
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,250
Um, that doesn't work too
well, in our experience.

202
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,770
In a software,

203
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,250
people really should be
starting software companies.

204
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,970
Media people should be
starting media companies.

205
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,760
Um, so and in the YC
experience, two or

206
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,130
three co-founders seems to
be about perfect.

207
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,270
Um, one obviously not great,

208
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,240
five really bad, four works
sometimes, but uh, two or

209
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,630
three I think is what to
target.

210
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay, the second part of how
to hire.

211
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,220
Um, try not to.

212
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,820
So one of the weird things
that you'll notice if

213
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,840
you start a company is that
everyone asks you

214
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,930
how many employees you have.

215
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,240
And this is the metric
people use to sort of

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,180
judge how real your start up
is and how cool you are.

217
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,970
Um, and if you say you have
a high number of employees,

218
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,260
they're really impressed.

219
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,290
And if you say you have a
low number of employees

220
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,790
then, then you sound like
sort of this little joke.

221
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,870
Um, but actually it sucks to
have a lot of employees and

222
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,400
you should be proud of how
few employees you can have.

223
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,700
Lots of employees ends up
with things like a high burn

224
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,760
rate, meaning that you're
losing a lot of money every

225
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,320
month, complexity, tension,
slow decision making.

226
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,180
The list goes on but it's
nothing good.

227
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,960
So you want to, you want to
be proud of how much you can

228
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,350
get done with a small number
of employees.

229
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,160
Um, many of the best YC
companies have had

230
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,840
phenomenally small number of
employees for

231
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,480
the first year, sometimes
none besides the founders.

232
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,640
Um, they really try to

233
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,480
stay small as long as they
possibly can.

234
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,610
At the beginning, you should
only hire when you

235
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,900
have the desperate need to.

236
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,756
Later you need to learn how
to hire fast to scale up

237
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:25,920
the company.

238
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,142
But in the early days uh,

239
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:30,460
the goal should be not to
hire, not too higher.

240
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,360
And one of the reasons this
is so bad is that

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,860
the cost of getting a early
hire wrong is really high.

242
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,300
Um, in fact a lot of the
companies that I have been

243
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,360
very involved with that have
had a very bad first hire

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,260
in the first three or

245
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,680
so employees never recover
from it.

246
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,390
It just kills the company.

247
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,720
Um, Airbnb spent five months
interviewing their first

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,700
employee before they hired
someone.

249
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,450
And in their first year they
only hired two people.

250
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,740
Um, before they hired a
single person they,

251
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,650
they wrote down a list of
the cultural values that

252
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,820
they wanted any Airbnb
employee to have.
