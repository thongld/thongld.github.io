00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,040

Can we keep playing, wait,
okay good.

2
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:10,845
Can we turn it up a little
bit, so it's more pumped up?

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:11,846
>> That's loud.

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,514
>> Okay, here we go, okay.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,774
>> Okay, so we gotta find
the beat and

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:21,999
then we gotta clap to the
beat.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,594
>> Okay.

8
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,361
All right.

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,632
Okay, that's pretty good
guys.

10
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,333
All right, we're good.

11
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:32,833
We're good.

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,634
Thank you.

13
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,869
Okay, please stop.

14
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,303
Okay, stop the music.

15
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,803
Thank you.

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,049
Okay, cool.
Can you put on

17
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:40,141
the presentation, thank you.

18
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,508
>> That'll be the most
pumped up

19
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:45,734
thing that ever happens in
enterprise software, so

20
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:48,223
the rest is sort of downhill
from here.

21
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,870
>> So, thank you for that
intro,

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,320
that well-rehearsed intro,
thank you.

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,381
>> Confirming the facts as
you're saying them,

24
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,600
very good.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,744
So I'm Aaron Levie, CEO and
co-founder of Box.

26
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:06,078
Welcome to this edition of
how to

27
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:11,570
build an enterprise software
company.

28
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,350
That's my understanding.
This is the course that

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,110
you're taking, right, is
that correct?

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,378
>> No, okay, so.

31
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,750
>> Here's my job today.

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,820
My job is to try and

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,210
convince you that everybody
else who speaks throughout

34
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,040
this whole class is wrong
and that you

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,060
actually wanna build an
enterprise software company.

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,620
And so hopefully we'll be
able to

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,900
kinda work through this, and
you'll have a good sense of

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,740
why it's super cool to be in
the enterprise.

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,570
And why a lot of the
perceptions of

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,710
going into the whole
consumer space, where it's,

41
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,300
you know, so much fun and
everything.

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,520
Why that's wrong and

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,000
why you wanna do enterprise
software.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,260
Who wants to build an
enterprise software company?

45
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,230
Good, all right.

46
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,420
Thank you very much.

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,782
Hopefully we'll do a vote at
the end and

48
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:56,740
hopefully that will not have
shrunk.

49
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,890
So that's really actually
the only goal I

50
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,070
have at this point.

51
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,380
So, we're gonna talk about
three things today.

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,780
The first is the quick
background and

53
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,980
history of Box.

54
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
Cuz when we started the
company, we didn't know that

55
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,960
we wanted to do enterprise
software and so I wanna kind

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,310
of get through a little bit
about why we decided to

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,880
go after the enterprise and
what we do today.

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,350
And then I'm gonna talk a
little bit

59
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,050
about what are the major
kind of factors that

60
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,600
have changed in enterprise
software that make it

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,880
possible to do a start up
today in this category.

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,360
And then finally we'll talk
a little

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,420
about some patterns that you
can kind of exploit and

64
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,770
some ways to recognize and
ways to actually go

65
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,860
build an enterprise software
company yourself and

66
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,760
hopefully that'll be some
practical, useful advice.

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,890
Just as a forewarning, my
voice,

68
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,848
as I've been speaking a lot
the past couple days.

69
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:51,600
So hopefully, I'll be able
to get to that third part of

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,120
the advice and actually be
able to talk, so we'll see

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,520
how we make it but I'm gonna
be downing a lot of water so

72
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,300
I apologize for that.

73
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,420
So building for the
enterprise.

74
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,020
This is what we're gonna
talk about.

75
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,668
So just quick kinda high
level stats about Box.

76
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,884
We've about 240,000
businesses that use

77
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,080
the product.

78
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,402
There are over 27 million
users that have brought Box

79
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,723
into their organization and
used it as individuals and

80
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:18,550
we're in about 99% of the
Fortune 500.

81
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,340
Unfortunately that last 1%
is really just Microsoft.

82
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,539
And they don't seem to wanna
buy from us.

83
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,930
So.

84
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,452
>> We have to work on that a
little bit.

85
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:30,630
But certainly, a decent
amount of scale,

86
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,050
a lot of users that have
brought Box into

87
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,870
enterprise environments,
these are some of

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,120
the large organizations that
are using the product.

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,980
So, a very wide range of
industries, everything from

90
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,290
manufacturing and consumer
products to companies like

91
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:45,910
General Electric.

92
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,960
Stanford Healthcare actually
uses the product for

93
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,370
collaboration within the
hospital environments and

94
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,600
the research.

95
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,510
But between healthcare,
media, manufacturing.

96
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,740
These are the sort of the
range of

97
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,997
industries that we serve.

98
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,660
So, the question's how did
we get here?

99
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,902
Cuz we didn't really start
the company to try and

100
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,982
go build an enterprise
software company even

101
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:09,780
though that is how things
ended up happening.

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,430
So when we started the
product, so

103
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,070
we launched the company in
2005.

104
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,740
We got the idea actually in
college back in 2004.

105
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,760
And so, was anybody using
the internet back in 2004?

106
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,260
Okay great.

107
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,440
So basically, I don't know
if

108
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,750
millennials use the internet
back then.

109
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,260
Sorry.

110
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,971
Okay, no more age jokes.

111
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,772
All right, here's the point.

112
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,959
So, back in 2004, you might
remember that there wasn't

113
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,377
a lot to do on the internet.

114
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,629
It was actually kind of
boring right?

115
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,160
This is before Facebook.

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,220
This is certainly before
Snapchat.

117
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,680
So not a lot of things that
you could go to,

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,230
you couldn't send people 15
second messages and

119
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,220
photos that disappeared,

120
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,090
cuz you didn't even have a
phone to send them photos.

121
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,470
So in the internet in 2004,
there wasn't a lot going on.

122
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,090
This was basically what the
internet looked like.

123
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,240
Sort of a barren, deserted
landscape and

124
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,770
this was the internet and
just to clarify,

125
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,049
the happy camel's Google and
the sad camel's Yahoo!

126
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,677
>> And that was effectively
the internet and

127
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:11,115
this is accurate, this is
the internet in 2004.

128
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,240
Yahoo has done a lot better
since then but,

129
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,300
but back in the middle 2000s

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,360
they were certainly trying
to find their way and

131
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,500
Google was sort of taking
over the world but

132
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,300
this was the entire, this
was the extent of the world.

133
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,403
So, what we noticed in 2004
in college was that it was,

134
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:27,263
for some reason, and this
isn't so

135
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:28,441
much the case today but

136
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,530
back in 2004 it was like,
really hard to share files.

137
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,960
And as simple of an idea as
that is now, you go back

138
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,730
ten years and it was either
really expensive or

139
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,390
it was really hard to

140
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,755
move data through different
corporate networks.

141
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:44,870
So I had an internship at
the time,

142
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,380
and in the internship, most
of my job using data was

143
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,080
actually just to copy
printed out pages and

144
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,160
then put them in cabinets.

145
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,550
That's what you do

146
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,990
as an intern if you're not a
computer science student.

147
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,595
So I was really, really good
at copying paper.

148
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:06,640
And unfortunately not a
skill that has

149
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,045
really been useful today.

150
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,060
But, it was really hard to
share files and

151
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,980
then in classroom
environments you

152
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,950
were constantly working with
lots of other people and

153
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,370
it was also hard to share
files.

154
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,860
I went to USC.

155
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,560
And USC gave you 50
megabytes of online storage

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,010
space in your email account.

157
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,920
50 megabytes.

158
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,760
So you can basically store
about one file and

159
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,210
then it would auto-delete
every six months.

160
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,390
I don't know who was running
IT at the time but

161
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,520
they certainly didn't buy
hard drives.

162
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,320
So, there was just really,
really hard to store and

163
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,880
share files.

164
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,260
And so we said, well,

165
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,380
why don't we make it really
easy to store and

166
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,320
share files from anywhere?

167
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,100
And so we got this idea for,

168
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,230
at the time it was called
box.net.

169
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,380
And what we noticed was
there were a bunch of

170
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,040
factors that had changed in
the software world.

171
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,720
The first was that the cost
of storage was sort of

172
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,010
dropping dramatically.

173
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,490
So, in our business,
basically every year or

174
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,450
two, you can double the
amount of data and

175
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,122
storage that goes in to a
hard drive.

176
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:12,390
So, what was uneconomical
two or three years ago,

177
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,040
all of the sudden becomes
feasible because the cost of

178
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,580
computing and the cost of
storage has dropped.

179
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,076
We had more powerful
browsers and networks so

180
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:24,618
Firefox was just emerging,
people were using the much

181
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,159
faster internet in both
their homes and

182
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,840
in the classroom.

183
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,810
And then people had more
locations that they

184
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,400
wanted to store and share
information from.

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,740
And so we had these sort of
three factors that all of

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,300
a sudden were emerging.

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,490
And I'm gonna sort of pull
these factors back

188
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,850
later when I give some sort
of tactical advice but

189
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,210
sort of the first point to
remember is, always look for

190
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,180
these changing technology
factors.

191
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,823
Cuz any market that has a
significant change in

192
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:51,196
the underlying, either raw
materials or

193
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:54,180
enabling factors is an
environment that's about to

194
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,167
change in a very significant
way.

195
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,553
And so we were very
fortunate that basically

196
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,846
the need for data in the
cloud was growing in

197
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,133
importance, and the cost and

198
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:09,560
the feasibility of doing it
was also improving rapidly.

199
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,918
And so we decided to put
together this really quick

200
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,219
version of Box, we launched
it as box.net, and

201
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,800
the idea was, let's make it
really easy to share files.

202
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,380
And it turned out that the
idea clicked.

203
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,320
We got angel funding from
this guy named Mark Cuban.

204
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,110
And this was before Shark
Tank, but

205
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,520
it was very similar.

206
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
And so, we got this funding,
and we decided that, okay.

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,790
This is gonna be super
exciting.

208
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,060
We are going to drop out of
college.

209
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,450
We're gonna move to the Bay
Area, and

210
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,510
it's gonna be totally
awesome.

211
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,460
And when you drop out of
college.

212
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,130
Anybody drop out of college
yet?

213
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,565
Okay, good, stay in school.

214
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:44,340
So when you drop out of
college, like everyone sort

215
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,090
of pictures it, it's just
gonna be, you know,

216
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,750
incredible, like Bill Gates
dropped out of college.

217
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,012
It will be like Bill Gates,
or

218
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,676
Michael Dell dropped out of
college and

219
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:53,695
it'll be super exciting like
Michael Dell, or

220
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,309
Steve Jobs dropped out of
college, so

221
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:56,970
this is what people imagine.

222
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,270
But nobody ever remembers
that this guy dropped out of

223
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,890
college also.

224
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,160
>> And, so it's not really a
guarantee obviously that

225
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,085
it's gonna be successful.

226
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,290
But, it's what you do, and
actually, funny,

227
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,130
I don't even know if this
guy dropped out of college.

228
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,510
>> It just sort of looks
like he had to.

229
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,787
>> I apologize if anyone's
related to him,

230
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:21,261
it's just a funny picture on
the internet.

231
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,629
So.

232
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,744
>> So basically we decided
we would drop out of

233
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:25,280
college.

234
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,670
We moved up to first Berkley
and

235
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,245
then we moved to Palo Alto a
little bit thereafter.

236
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:33,427
And we decided that we were
gonna open up the product

237
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:34,100
for free.

238
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,920
We got hundreds of thousands
of people that would sign up

239
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,470
for the product every single
month.

240
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,533
So, we had a free version of
the product called,

241
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,893
if you went to box.net, you
got a free one gigabyte of

242
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,986
file storage space, which
was,

243
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,224
again, quite a bit back in
2006 at this point.

244
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,097
But we were getting so many
users and

245
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:56,099
we were trying to figure out
what to do.

246
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:59,195
And what we ran into was a
common problem that really

247
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,220
any startup runs into but
was really pronounced by

248
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,534
our business model, which
was that for consumers, we

249
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:09,690
had built a very robust, a
very comprehensive product.

250
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,175
And for enterprises,

251
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:14,940
we had actually built too
insignificant of a product.

252
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,800
So, for consumers, what we
were running into was, we

253
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,030
had all these features that
you could pay for but a lot

254
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,070
of the consumers didn't need
all of those features.

255
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,020
And for enterprises,

256
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,500
we didn't really have
enough, security.

257
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,310
And we didn't have enough
capabilities around how

258
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,220
enterprises wanted to use
their data.

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,330
So we basically had more
functionality than what

260
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,080
a consumer wanted and less
than what enterprise wanted.

261
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,420
And so we found ourselves at
this juncture.

262
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,380
And we found ourselves
basically in this

263
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,090
period where it's very
difficult to figure out what

264
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,820
we wanted to go do with the
business, so

265
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,890
we had to make a choice,
right?

266
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,360
And so we were at this path
where basically,

267
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,380
we're at a juncture where we
had to

268
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,090
choose which path do go
down.

269
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:00,760
And this was back in early,
mid 2006, up to late 2006,

270
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,970
so I was, I think, 23 at the
time.

271
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,150
The co-founder was, was 22.

272
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,625
Our founding team was even
younger.

273
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,540
When we all dropped out of
college.

274
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,365
And so back in 2006, 2007,
we imagined these two

275
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:18,580
paths and the worlds were
very, very different.

276
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,150
Like when you do a consumer
start up,

277
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,280
it's basically just lots of
fun.

278
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,050
And, you know?

279
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,770
You have parties all the
time.

280
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,902
And it's just super
exciting.

281
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,330
And then the enterprise,

282
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,900
you basically are battling
these just large incumbents.

283
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
It's a fairly thankless, you
know?

284
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,730
Model because you know?

285
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,330
People just generally hate
enterprise software.

286
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,805
So that was sort of how we
imagined that the two

287
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,260
paths was, we had to choose,
you know,

288
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,340
one of these two worlds.

289
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,340
And so we looked at that and

290
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,170
we said okay, well consumer
looks really fun,

291
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,450
enterprise looks really hard
and,
