Thank you Sam.

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:06,760
So when I looked through the
syllabus of this class and

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,180
thought about what I, I could
possibly add that would be

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,780
useful in addition to the
various skills.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,850
One of the things that I had
been thinking about had been,

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,430
how do you think about
yourself as founder,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,800
how do you think about what
the skill set is?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,640
And what are the things that
you should be

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,810
thinking about in terms of am
I ready, how do I get ready,

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,810
is it the right thing for me?

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,270
These sorts of things.

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,420
So let's start with the
perception of what

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,060
a great founder is.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,090
And classically, you know,
this tends to be Steve Jobs,

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,190
Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark
Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos.

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,804
And it's an image of founder
as superwoman or superman

17
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:52,450
right, who is, has this like
panopticon of skills, and

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,310
I can use the word panopticon
because I'm here at Stanford.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,560
But the, it's,

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,310
it's things like, I know how
to do product market fit.

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm great at product, I'm
great at strategy,

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm great at management, I can
fundraise.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,370
I can do all of these
different skills.

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,940
And a part of what you're
looking for

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,570
in a great founder, in the
kind of theory of

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,960
the founder as superperson, is
I'm looking for

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
someone who is awesome at all
these things.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,540
They are, they are, they are
well rounded,

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,270
they are diverse, they can bat
on all skills.

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,750
And you know, part of how I
found this kind of emphasized

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,330
in my own, the beginning of my
own entrepreneurial journey,

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,480
is I remember reading an
article that said,

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,930
you know, Bill Gates, who is
smarter than Einstein, right?

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,440
And you're like, well look,

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,600
Bill Gates is really smart and
he's very accomplished.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,760
But I'm not quite sure smarter
than Einstein is actually

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,170
a phrase that even Bill would
want to be actually next to.

38
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,210
And it's partially because I
think it's this image of

39
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,450
founder as superperson, which
is that a great founder is

40
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,710
someone who can do anything,
you know,

41
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,030
jump over tall tall buildings
in a single bound, you know,

42
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,430
all of these sorts of things.

43
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,470
And the reality, right, is the
founder is someone who

44
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,670
deals with a ton of different
headaches.

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,800
And no one is universally
super powered.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,690
Generally speaking,

47
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,350
you hope to have a couple of
super powers.

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,510
Some things that are unique
edge to you.

49
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,590
Some things that are unique to

50
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,820
the problem that you are
trying to solve.

51
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,990
Some things that may help you
give an edge because actually

52
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,250
competitive differentiation
and

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,980
competitive edge is super
important.

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,950
But but it's not it's not
actually in fact a,

55
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,930
a function of, of genius.

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,460
And matter of fact frequently
it's very hard to

57
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,700
tell the difference between
madness and

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,560
genius, because usually it's
the results that play out.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,880
And sometimes when you're
dealing with

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,250
uncertain environments, you
may even be genius and

61
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,000
later be thought to be a mad
person.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,010
Or you may be a mad person and
you turn out to be lucky.

63
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,660
And you're later thought to be
a genius.

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,880
So it's, it's actually a kind
of challenging set of, like,

65
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,820
how do you think about, you
know, these sets, you know,

66
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,310
what is the whole set of
skills and

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,390
what us mere mortals, you
know, come into this kind of

68
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,290
battle what is the right way
to think about it?

69
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,300
And so you know, when I

70
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,200
thought about this question of
how is one a great founder.

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,360
You know, part of what you get
to is.

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,970
Oh, and actually, this is
probably the slide that for

73
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,720
people on this, this may have
been a suboptimal choice for

74
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
people on video, but it's
like,

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,240
these are all skills that are
super important.

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Right?

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,590
These are all things that you
say, well, okay, this is,

78
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,300
this is really, really
important to do and

79
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
you must in fact actually do
this well, and

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,570
it begins to look like a
superhuman task.

81
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,600
And so what did, I decided to
take a,

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,730
a subset of these and focused
on some of the,

83
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,020
the interesting things to
think about,

84
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,930
what is it that actually makes
a great founder?

85
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,280
Because it's actually not that
you score ten out of ten on

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,250
all these, you know, you're,

87
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,930
you're the entrepreneurial
Olympiad.

88
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,409
You, you are actually the best
at all of these things.

89
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,260
So let's start with team.

90
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,150
So one way to kind of, I
think, talk about

91
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,070
exploding the kind of the myth
of the super founder is that

92
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,300
actually in fact usually it's
best so have two or

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,920
three people on a team rather
than a solar founder.

94
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,010
Not to say solar founders
don't actually play out and

95
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,330
they can successfully.

96
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,440
But most often, two or three
people is actually in fact

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,638
a much better, when I look at
these things as an investor,

98
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:22,220
and I say, you know, what is a
good composition of

99
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,700
a project and a, and founders
that are likely to succeed.

100
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,230
It's usually there's two or
three of them, and

101
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,410
the reasons are, because for
example we've already talked

102
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,830
about the fact that there's
this very broad set of skills.

103
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,030
There's this whole set of
question about how

104
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,050
you adapt your company in
order to be successful, and

105
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,670
if you actually have two or
three founders, you have,

106
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,960
you have different skills, you
can compensate because,

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
by the way, everyone has
weaknesses.

108
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,510
You can compensate for each
other's weaknesses.

109
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,830
You can in the diversity of
problems that you

110
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,530
encounter as a founder that
you can actually attack them.

111
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,390
So one of the things that I, I
suggest when you,

112
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,640
when you look at essentially a
founding team is to

113
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,170
have a real high preference
for having co-founders,

114
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,560
having a high degree of trust
with those co-founders.

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,370
Because one of the things, by
the way, part of the whole

116
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,910
entrepreneurial thing is
there's lots of ways to die.

117
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,830
One of the ways to die is you
get a year down the road with

118
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,600
your co-founders and

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,960
then you're going through a
messy divorce.

120
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,870
And that's a,

121
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,760
that's a, that is not always
but frequently fatal.

122
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,740
And so and then also the
diversity of the kind of

123
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,120
tasks that you're trying to
do.

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,030
And actually.

125
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,200
>> Okay, yes, I was about to
say,

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,420
that would be suboptimal from
the viewpoint of being able to

127
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,520
look at the slides.

128
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,330
The next thing is location.

129
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,940
And so frequently I've heard,
told to me, it's like oh,

130
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,680
Silicon Valley aggregates all
of this super talent,

131
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,370
which it does.

132
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,330
In terms of, like, what, what
actually in fact, it's, it's,

133
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,550
the reason why Silicon Valley
startups are so successful is

134
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,050
because all of these great
people immigration,

135
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,830
which is hugely important for,
for talent and

136
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,240
founders and everything else,
you know, emigrate here.

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,270
And that's part of the reason.

138
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,000
Now, it's actually, if you
think about it,

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,010
from basic math, ne, even if
you take something that,

140
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,010
that Silicon Valley is super
strong at, which is

141
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,850
essentially software skills in
the last two decades.

142
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,420
Not all of the great software
people move here.

143
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,730
No, not all of 'em can move
here.

144
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,610
There are many of

145
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,270
them in various other parts of
the world.

146
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,780
And, and so why do I put
choice of location as one of

147
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,000
the things it comes down to,
thinking whether or

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,480
not you're a great founder.

149
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,510
Well, the reason is, is
because what fo,

150
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,410
great founders do is seek the
networks that will be

151
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,830
essential to their problem and
their task.

152
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,120
And they realize that it isn't
just about, like,

153
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,950
kind of like, I am super
person.

154
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,060
I can do this anywhere.

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,989
I can do this, you know, in,

156
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,950
you know, the Antarctic, et
cetera.

157
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,320
It's, in order to be
successful I have to go to

158
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,050
where the strongest networks
are for the particular kind of

159
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,090
problem or the particular kind
of thing that I'm doing.

160
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:05,590
And Silicon Valley, by the
way,

161
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,720
is super good at some kind of
tasks.

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,550
Some places that you
essentially try to

163
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,830
solve certain kinds of
problems.

164
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,010
But it's not good at all of
them.

165
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,070
Let me take, you know, kind of
two examples.

166
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,160
So one is Groupon.

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,460
I don't think Groupon could've
ever been founded here.

168
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,060
Even though it's a software
product,

169
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,950
it actually even generates a
network.

170
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,750
Which, you know, obviously a
lot of the great networks

171
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,990
are here and and uses a a kind
of Internet technology

172
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,670
as a mobile product and
everything else, all of

173
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,250
which we have a lot of skills
here in Silicon Valley and

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,120
the networks are really good
for this.

175
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,950
One of the things that's
central for GroupOn for

176
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,150
it's early days was having
massive sales forces, and

177
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,670
massive sales forces strengths
and

178
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,190
weaknesses of networks tend to
go together.

179
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,320
Silicon Valley tends to be
pretty adverse to plans that

180
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,380
involve, like oh,

181
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,120
we're going to rent a 25 story
building and in 20 of

182
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,570
those stories we're going to
have floors of sales people,

183
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,630
and that's how we're going to
get out thing going.

184
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,080
That kind of plan here tends
to not get a lot of interest,

185
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,240
tends to get a lot of
criticism,

186
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,540
tends to not have talent po-,

187
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,710
aggregate to it, tends to have
financiers talk up of

188
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,440
things like capital efficiency
and network effects and

189
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,850
other kinds of things that
are, that are key here.

190
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,230
And so it's actually not a
surprise that actually,

191
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,260
in fact, Groupon require, was
required to be actually in

192
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,200
Chicago, which is really good
at this.

193
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,820
As a way of actually kind of
getting going, and showing

194
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,820
that even software startups
can be in other places.

195
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,640
But even if you begin to think
about you say,

196
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,718
okay, well what kinds of, of,
of you know, other kinds of

197
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:42,190
startups would someone be an
idiot to move here to do.

198
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,270
Think of someone were doing a
fashion start up.

199
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,529
Not fashion a la Poshmark
which is you know,

200
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,461
a mobile marketplace et cetera
which are a bunch of things

201
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,810
that are good here.

202
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,600
But like I'm develop,

203
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,270
designing a new fashion
company and

204
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,570
I'm going to come to silicon
valley to do it.

205
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,445
That's actually not such a
great idea.

206
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,100
Right not saying the fashion
company might be a great idea

207
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,600
but you want the networks that
support what you're doing.

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,790
And so part of the reason why
where I,

209
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,780
where I locate my startup is a
test for thinking

210
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,150
about am I a great founder is
because part of what happens

211
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,360
when you're actually founding
a company is you're going,

212
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,150
I will go to where it's
successful to this to do.

213
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,410
To, to, to be because the
metaphor that I frequently use

214
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,280
for entrepreneurship is
jumping off a cliff and

215
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,620
assembling an airplane on the
way down,

216
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,410
and the reason is because it's
hard, it has

217
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,810
a quasi-mortal exit by which
you're default dead, and so

218
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,310
you're taking every possible
chance to actually win.

219
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,610
And so great founders go,
look,

220
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,560
I'll move to what the network
is and that network is,

221
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,280
you know, this graphic is
frequently Silicon Valley.

222
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,010
But for, for text startups,
for mobile, for

223
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,310
networks, for marketplaces,
you know,

224
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,790
this is a really good place to
do it.

225
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,000
For a bunch of other things
you

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,350
should think about whether or
not it's a different location.

227
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,580
Now here's something that, you
know,

228
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,320
it's very in vogue, all right,

229
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,969
very conventional, to say
you're contrarian these days.

230
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,080
And so, let's talk a little
bit about what contrarianness

231
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,230
actually in fact is.

232
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,730
so, it's actually pretty easy
to be contrarian.

233
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,970
It's hard to be contrarian and
right.

234
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,390
And in particular, when you're
thinking about,

235
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,419
is my idea contrarian or
contrarian enough.

236
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,746
It's how does a smart person
actually disagree with

237
00:10:24,746 --> 00:10:25,639
me right?

238
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:29,435
Is, because if you can't think
of a smart person-

239
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:32,297
Who isn't like ignorant or
just crazy or isn't, but

240
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,904
is a smart person who is
somewhat expert in that so

241
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,701
thinks that your idea has some
serious challenges,

242
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,590
then it actually isn't
contrarian.

243
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,500
Right?
So contrarian, and
