763
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,555

For my Christmas gifts.

764
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,044
And I didn't really like to
do it but

765
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,750
the following year all my
presents were super good.

766
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,170
So, I think we should try
this for our business and

767
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,770
see how it goes.

768
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,320
So, that first year we wrote
handwritten Christmas cards

769
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,750
to all of our users that
first year.

770
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,360
Second year rolls around,
and

771
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,680
we have too many customers,
like, and

772
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,670
it's still just the three
founders.

773
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,920
And we were going like we're
kinda screwed,

774
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,650
I don't know what we're
gonna do.

775
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,940
And we read a book called
the ultimate question, and

776
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,540
in it he talks about hey,

777
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,490
just focus on your most
profitable users.

778
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,510
And just tend them and

779
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,330
take care of them, then
it'll work out.

780
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,910
So we're like, all right,

781
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,000
that, that makes sense,
that's scalable.

782
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,770
So that year we

783
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,459
only write to our highest
paying customers.

784
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,630
And the January rolls around
that second year and

785
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,540
one of our long time loyal
users writes us and

786
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,620
he's basically like, hey
guys I, I really loved

787
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,290
that Christmas card you sent
me the first year and I just

788
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,000
wanted you to know I haven't
received my second card yet

789
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,520
and I'm just looking forward
to it.

790
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,040
I know you didn't forget
about me.

791
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,400
Thanks a lot.

792
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,930
So we're like, fuck, because
the best way to sort of

793
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,890
exceed expectations is not
to send any to begin with,

794
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,500
so we were like sort of in
this conundrum.

795
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,940
And what we decided, after
thinking about it for

796
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,270
a while, is that we need to
stop doing it,

797
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,400
you know, just one time a
year.

798
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,760
It needs to be something
that's part of the culture.

799
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,800
Happens every, every, every
sort of week, even.

800
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,950
And even though we'll never
catch up to all of

801
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,050
our customers.

802
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,710
Just the practice of

803
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,490
doing it will make all the
difference.

804
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,310
I talked a lot

805
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,320
about a bunch of like
lovey-dovey stuff and

806
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,470
sort of like touchy-feely
things that I think a lot of

807
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,450
engineers don't like to
think about too often.

808
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,570
And so I'll end on some sort
of hard business

809
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,320
data or research.

810
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
There's an article that was
put out by

811
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,220
the Harvard Business Review
several years ago by

812
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,080
Michael Treacy and Fred
Wiersema and in it they

813
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,560
talk about the discipline of
market leaders.

814
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,360
They say there's only three
ways that you

815
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,630
achieve market dominance and
depending on how you want to

816
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,300
achieve that market
dominance you have

817
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,870
to organize your company in
a very specific way.

818
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,350
Best price, best product and
best overall solution.

819
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,860
If you want to be

820
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,270
the best price out there you
focus on logistics.

821
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,680
A Wal-Mart, an Amazon.

822
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,390
If you want to be the best
product out there you

823
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,540
focus on R&D.

824
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,460
Apple's usually

825
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,490
a quintessential example of
that.

826
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,040
Best overall solution is
about

827
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,930
being customer intimate.

828
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,410
And this is the path that
you see followed by

829
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,950
luxury brands and
hospitality industry.

830
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,400
What I love about this path
towards market dominance is

831
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,750
that the third one is the
only one that

832
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,620
everyone can do at any stage
of their company.

833
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,460
Requires almost no money to
get started with.

834
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,540
Usually just co.

835
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,780
Requires a little bit of
humility and some manners.

836
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,590
And as a result you can
achieve the success as any

837
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,190
other people in sort of your
market.

838
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,680
That's all I got.

839
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,340
Thank you very much.

840
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,230
Yeah, let's take some
questions if you guys

841
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,912
have any.

842
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:04,854
Right in the back there.

843
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:07,339
>> Building products that
users love?

844
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,342
You might have multiple
different types of users.

845
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:14,150
How do you build one product
that all users love?

846
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,150
Maybe there is a feature
that one really likes but

847
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,110
detracts value from one
that.

848
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,150
>> All right.
So what do you do

849
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,950
when you have a product with
lots of

850
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,250
different type of users,
right?

851
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,490
Some users will love one
thing and

852
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,250
another will, will another.

853
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,970
And I agree, there's

854
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,290
a interesting fine line for
that.

855
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,370
What I always, usually tell
people,

856
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,070
is focus on the people who
are the most passionate,

857
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,360
especially in the early
stages.

858
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,020
Right?
Whoever's, whatever niche

859
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,320
it's gonna be, that's who I
focus on completely.

860
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,280
Things that a lot of
different projects did.

861
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,140
I think Ben Silverman of

862
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,290
Pinterest started off with a
designer bloggers, right?

863
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,090
Curtail your thing for

864
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,610
them and eventually you'll
figure out sort of universal

865
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,150
values that will appeal to a
lot of other people.

866
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,920
So, just start one at a
time.

867
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,720
And.

868
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,900
The, a lot of the examples
that you see up there,

869
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,280
a lot of people make the
mistake is like, oh,

870
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,960
I'll just make my app funny.

871
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,130
But, humor is like really
difficult to do.

872
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,200
Right?
What you wanna shoot for

873
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,350
is something sort of witty.

874
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,720
And, quite honestly,

875
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,730
you have to get
functionality right.

876
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,220
So like the Japanese
quality.

877
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,210
If you don't have a on
there, right, don't try to

878
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,100
do anything witty, right,
cuz it will backfire on you.

879
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,807
So hands down, our number
one focus is make it as

880
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:18,108
easy to use as possible for
and

881
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:20,016
anything else on top was
polish.

882
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,596
Right here.

883
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:28,310
>> So so everybody says that
to focus on your product.

884
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,030
I'm also good at that.

885
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,300
I love to do a project and I
love to make it the best.

886
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,100
But we are to that certain
point that we are focused on

887
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,510
our product but we don't get
like constantly right?

888
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,270
Sorry.

889
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,640
So second thing so how much
we should focus on product?

890
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
But because we should do now
marketing.

891
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,490
We should get somebody
customers and

892
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,980
like and like start talking
to customers but

893
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,180
when you are too focused on
your product.

894
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,940
Like users online have them.

895
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,461
Right, so what exactly do
you guys mean when you

896
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,856
are saying like focus only
on your product and

897
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,130
give the best product?

898
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,548
>> Okay.

899
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,955
So the question sort of is
how do we balance this

900
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:07,889
sort of thing where we wanna
be obsessed with

901
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,800
working on product.

902
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,630
Yet.
But all the other skills,

903
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,080
and sort of tasks that are
needed by a company,

904
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,510
like marketing and branding
and

905
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,730
all that stuff, and how, how
we sort of balance that.

906
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,100
And the thing is, like, it
starts off as you juggling,

907
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,540
like, tons of things
constantly in the air.

908
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,440
The thing is, if you're
working on products, like,

909
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,500
you should also always have
this flip side as

910
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,050
when you're talking to
users.

911
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,560
Right?
And for

912
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,010
us inside of Wufoo, the way
we got people to talk to

913
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,440
users is they just did
customer support.

914
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,680
And they got to see
firsthand, right away.

915
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,930
Whether that feature sucked
or not,

916
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,500
and also impacted everyone
else in the company,

917
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,420
because everyone had a
customer support shift.

918
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,170
So you have this sort of
social incentive to sort of

919
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,360
make everything work.

920
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,150
And so, like I said, there
should be no point where

921
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,230
you're only focused on
product.

922
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,340
You should always have time
where you work on product,

923
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,420
and then you see sort of
what users say, say to you.

924
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,270
And you should always have
this virtual, like,

925
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,420
feedback loop on there.

926
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,630
So be careful when you don't
have that.

927
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,340
Usually what ends up
happening, if you're lucky.

928
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,070
In terms of marketing and

929
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,070
sales, like, usually my
feeling is like, you have to

930
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,090
spend money on marketing and
advertising, all this stuff.

931
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,680
It's usually a tax you pay
because you

932
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,280
haven't made your product
remarkable.

933
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,510
Right?

934
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,630
Word of mouth growth is the
easiest kind of growth, and

935
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,260
it's how a lot of the great
companies sort of grow.

936
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,220
So figure out how to wait,
how to like,

937
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,120
have a story that people
want to tell.

938
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,830
About your product.

939
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,400
Where they're the most
interesting person at

940
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,660
the dinner table, right?

941
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,820
And then that person is your
sales person, right?

942
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,462
That person is your sales
force for you.

943
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:28,106
Right here.

944
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:32,112
>> like, where do you find
crystal clear customer or

945
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:36,140
user need and the demand is
there is the right solution.

946
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,100
How do you communicate with
engineering and

947
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,710
designing team to make sure
that because sometimes

948
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,470
people in the team come up
with ideas, and but

949
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,620
still at the end of the day,

950
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,340
how can you make a decision
with where to go?

951
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,300
>> Oh, so how do you make a
decision on product?

952
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,000
And communicate that with
your sort of

953
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,350
engineering team when
there's like lots of

954
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,410
different directions to go?

955
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,950
My feeling is that.

956
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,180
So for us we just looked at
support.

957
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
It was really easy cuz

958
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,480
you often just saw what are
things that

959
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,410
people are having the most
amount of problems with?

960
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,980
Or people asking all the
time.

961
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,360
You cannot help but get
feature requests from

962
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
people no matter like
whatever opening or

963
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,940
orifice you have in your
product or app.

964
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,430
Like, people will like jam
feature requests in there.

965
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,210
So you're easily going to

966
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,450
know sort of what they sort
of what.

967
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,270
Your job as a product person
and

968
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,050
engineer is to not just do
what they say, because that

969
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,068
way, you'll just be a slave,
is to figure out,

970
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,930
sort of deeply, what are the
reasons why underlying those

971
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,410
things and sort of solve
that deep underlying reason.

972
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,606
The thing is that everyone
wants to

973
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:35,990
have a different way of.

974
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,390
To sort of go, then
ultimately it comes down to,

975
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,850
like, someone's gonna figure
something out.

976
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,180
But I also make the smallest
version of each little idea.

977
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,080
No longer than a week or two
weeks to build it out there.

978
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,980
And you can try them out and

979
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,890
see sort of what works and
don't work.

980
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,060
I think it's dangerous to

981
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,800
have multiple different
product directions that

982
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,879
requires lots of time to
sort of figure out.

983
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,050
Sam.

984
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,760
>> Related to that can you
tell the story of

985
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,910
how the king for a day thing
>> Yeah.

986
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,770
Okay.
So

987
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,760
so I don't like hackathons.

988
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,660
I think they sort of suck in
terms of ones done inside

989
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,210
of companies.

990
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,270
Because.

991
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,937
You spend like 48 hours
working on something really

992
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:16,125
hard that you're sort of
passionate about and

993
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:20,280
99% of them never make it to
production right, and

994
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,410
it's sort, sort of real like
super sad.

995
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,190
So for us we like flipped it
on it's head and

996
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,720
we came up with an idea that
we called king for

997
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,060
a day and it actually worked
over the weekend.

998
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,920
But how it worked is someone
randomly in the company got

999
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,660
drawn and they got to be the
king, and the king got to

1000
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,400
tell everyone else what to
do on the product.

1001
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,850
So everything that was
bothering them about Wufoo.

1002
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,890
About the customer support
stuff, or

1003
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,530
some feature they really
want to have built.

1004
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,440
They've got the engineering
resources, the market

1005
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,650
resources, the advertising
resources of everyone inside

1006
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,670
of the company, to make it
sort of happen.

1007
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,770
And of course, we'd work
with them to

1008
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,200
figure out like what can be
actually done in 48 hours.

1009
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,730
But we would do this one to
two times a year.

1010
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,820
And it was like a huge hit
and

1011
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,310
it was a boost to morale,
cuz what people most love.

1012
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,810
It is like working on things
where it's like, oh,

1013
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,020
I made a difference to the
app.

1014
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,700
Right?

1015
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,030
And so, for us, that's one
way that we would like

1016
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,370
sort of divide time for like
product direction.
