265
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs
All of them will tell you no.

266
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,320
So you're never 100%,

267
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,590
but you definitely want to get
a close to that as you can.

268
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,520
Next complicated topic is
delegating.

269
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,680
So just like the other thing I

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
like about the metaphor of
editing is.

271
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,090
Writers do most of the work in
the world.

272
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,000
Editors are not actually
writing most of the content in

273
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,380
any publication.

274
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,190
So that's actually true of
your company.

275
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,720
You are not going to do most
of the work.

276
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
You shouldn't be doing most of
the work.

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,210
And the way you get out of
doing most of

278
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,950
the work is you actually
delegate.

279
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,390
Now the problem with
delegating is,

280
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,300
that actually you're
responsible for everything.

281
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,800
So as CEO founder there is no
excuse,

282
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,510
there's no like that's that
department over there,

283
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,110
this person over there screwed
up,

284
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,390
you're always responsible for

285
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,530
every single thing, especially
when things go wrong.

286
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,790
So how do you both delegate
but not abdicate.

287
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,320
It's pretty tricky challenge
and

288
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,640
both are sins, like if you
over delegate.

289
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,146
Or, and you advocate, or

290
00:09:47,146 --> 00:09:49,850
you micro-manage, those are
both sins.

291
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,400
So I'm going to give you a
couple techniques for

292
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,120
solving this.

293
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,858
First, this actually comes
from high output management

294
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,740
and to grow, is what's known
as task-relevant maturity.

295
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,060
It's kind of a fancy phrase
for

296
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,820
basically, has this person
ever done this before?

297
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,010
It's really simple.

298
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,410
And how mature is this person
in doing something/ And

299
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,750
the more they've done the
exact same task before.

300
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,560
The more sort of rope you're
going to give them.

301
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,320
And the less, the more they're
trying something new,

302
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
the more you're going to
actually instruct them and

303
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,670
consistently, constantly
regularly monitor.

304
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,406
So that's kind of a basic
concept but

305
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,593
it's worth keeping in the back
of your brain.

306
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,766
The interesting implication,
and

307
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,737
this is pretty radical, is
that any executive,

308
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:29,569
any CEO should not have one
management style.

309
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,924
Your management style actually
needs to be dictated by

310
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:32,646
your employee.

311
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:35,685
So with one particular person,
you may be very much a micro

312
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:38,364
manager because they're quite
low on this scale.

313
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,370
And with another person you
may be delegating a lot

314
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,020
because they're actually quite
mature on this scale.

315
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,274
So it's actually a good thing
if you do reference checks on

316
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,574
somebody, and half the people
you call say they're a micro

317
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:49,644
manager, and the other half
say they actually give me

318
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:51,622
a lot of responsibility,
that's actually not a,

319
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:53,186
that's a, that's a feature not
a bug.

320
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,916
I didn't understand that at
first, at all, like I used to

321
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,817
be befuddled when people would
dereference checks on me, and

322
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:01,354
come back with this like,
complicated mosaic.

323
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,568
And that basically, finally
figured out that maybe I

324
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,386
was actually doing my job
correctly, and so

325
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:06,074
then of course,

326
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:08,824
thought other people that this
was the way to do it.

327
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:12,304
A more nuanced answer though,
that I've sort of came up

328
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,777
with, is how, how do you make
decisions?

329
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:17,276
And delegating versus doing it
yourself.

330
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,337
You don't want to do it
yourself too often.

331
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,813
So what I've basically
borrowed from Peter,

332
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:25,113
this is my first two by two
matrix ever in my life but he

333
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:28,351
taught me something at least
is you basically sort you,

334
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:31,269
your own level conviction
about a decision on a grid you

335
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,850
know, extremely high,
extremely low.

336
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,880
There's times when you know
something's a mistake, and

337
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,450
there's times where you
wouldn't do it that way, but

338
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,783
you have no real idea what
the, whether,

339
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,520
whether it's the right or
wrong answer.

340
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,440
And then there's a consequence
to mention, there are things

341
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,060
that if you make the wrong
decision are actually

342
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,480
catastrophic to your company
and you will fail.

343
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,280
There are things that are
pretty low impact,

344
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,420
that really at the end of the
day aren't going to

345
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,190
make a big difference, at
least initially.

346
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,275
So what I basically believe is
that where there's low

347
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,090
consequences, and

348
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,130
you have very a low confidence
in your own opinion, you

349
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,880
should absolutely delegate,
and delegate completely like

350
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,930
people make mistakes and
learn.

351
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,200
On the other side obviously,

352
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,980
where the consequences are
extremely dramatic and

353
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,590
you have extremely high
conviction that you're right,

354
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,060
you actually can't let your
junior colleague,

355
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,200
like, make a mistake.

356
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,100
You're ultimately responsible
for that mistake, and if

357
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,140
it's really important you just
can't allow that to happen.

358
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,080
Now the best way to do

359
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,140
that is to actually explain
your thinking, the why.

360
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,680
It's easy to shortcut when you
get busy,

361
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,500
explaining why's of the world,
but it's very important to try

362
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,710
when I was at LinkedIn I had a
colleague who's quite,

363
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,678
quite talented.

364
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:40,240
Both occasion we get annoyed
if, if I didn't exactly agree

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,870
with his opinion on something,
and so I'd

366
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,700
spent a lot of time trying to
persuade him why I was making

367
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,150
a decision a certain way.

368
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,580
And his wildcard, the card he
would ultimately call out if I

369
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,680
didn't quite persuade him,

370
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,510
he's like, okay you're the
boss, and that meant to

371
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,680
me like I was burning a lot of
social capital.

372
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,260
Every time he said that, I
knew I was like

373
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,150
really creating a thin line,
and that ultimately that was

374
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,970
going to backfire if I did
that too often, so

375
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,440
you want to track the times
that you're doing that.

376
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,580
Example of this is Squares,

377
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,870
one of my favorite people in
the world,

378
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,850
and my second hire, first
marketing hire had this

379
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,890
program he wanted to run
called Inner-Square,

380
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,740
which basically allowed people
to give out square merchants

381
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,860
to get out ten other squares
to their call.

382
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,210
Just imagine a food truck
outside,

383
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,590
put like ten squares on the
counter and

384
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,500
people could just grab them,
and Kyle had this great idea,

385
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,560
this would be this awesome
marketing program.

386
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,510
Squares would spread squares
to other people and, you know,

387
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,660
to some extent it was on
brand, so

388
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,940
it didn't have catastrophic
consequences.

389
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,300
Each of these ten squares
didn't cost that much money,

390
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
so financially we could afford
to do it.

391
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,120
But, at that time my ten years
of experience said

392
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,490
there's just no way this is
going to work in

393
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,930
a meaningful enough scale, to
move our metrics enough and

394
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,957
I actually would prefer we
don't, not do this.

395
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:50,470
But Kyle, so

396
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,490
excited about this that I
decided to just let him do it.

397
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,680
He learned that actually when
you

398
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,550
measure this thing it's not
massive.

399
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,900
It doesn't create a massive
value for the company.

400
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,950
It did require a fair amount
of operational complexity to

401
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,170
ship all these squares to
people and

402
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,730
figure out how to get them to
be squares etc.

403
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,620
But it allowed him to be
excited about his job and

404
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,720
to learn how to filter future
ideas, so it's totally worth

405
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,320
letting him make the quote
unquote mistake.

406
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,280
The next and most possibly
most important thing you do

407
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,070
is actually edit the team.

408
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,845
So these are the people that
you work with, and

409
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,750
nobody's going to have a
perfect team and

410
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,510
you're certainly not going to
start that way.

411
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,250
So would, I'm going to try to
do is

412
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,490
maximize the probability for
success in editing the team.

413
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,890
So I like this idea of Barrels
and Ammunition.

414
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,878
Most companies once they get
into hiring mode as

415
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,113
Sam pointed out you should
defer that for awhile, but

416
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,862
once you do they just hire a
lot of people.

417
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,505
And they're like, you expect,
and

418
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:44,679
you expected as you add people
your throughput,

419
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,634
your horsepower, or

420
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,243
your velocity of shipping
things is going to increase.

421
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,099
It turns out it doesn't work
that way.

422
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,741
Usually when you hire more
engineers you

423
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,430
actually don't get that much
more done,

424
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,420
you actually sometimes get
less done.

425
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,280
You hire more designers,

426
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,450
you definitely don't get more
done,

427
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,200
you get less done per day we
could talk about why.

428
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,290
But so the reason why is that
most people,

429
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,540
most great people even, are
actually ammunition.

430
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,320
But what you need in your
company are barrels, and

431
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,960
you can only shoot through the
number of

432
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,420
unique barrels you have.

433
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,670
So that's how the velocity of
your company improves is by

434
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,570
adding barrels, and then you
stock them with ammunition,

435
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,710
and then you can do a lot.

436
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,310
So if you go from a one barrel
company,

437
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,990
which is mostly how you start.

438
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,000
To two barrel companies
suddenly you get twice as many

439
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,390
things done per day, per week,
per quarter, and if you go to

440
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,970
three barrels, great, if you
go to four barrels, awesome.

441
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,920
Barrels are incredibly
difficult to find,

442
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,010
but when you have them, like
give them lots of equity,

443
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,480
promote them, take them to
dinner every week because it,

444
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,300
it, they're virtually it like
irreplaceable.

445
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,800
Because they're also very
culturally specific.

446
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,980
So a barrel at one company may
not be a barrel at

447
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,570
another company because one of
the ways in the definition of

448
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,210
a barrel is they can take an
idea from inception

449
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,410
all the way through shipping
and bring people with them.

450
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:57,230
And that's a very culturally
specific opportunity specific

451
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,260
skill set, rather.

452
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,490
So two questions probably are
occurring to you,

453
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,620
is how do you figure out who's
a barrel and who's not?

454
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,330
One is you start actually with
a very small set of

455
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,100
responsibilities.

456
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,670
It can be fairly trivial.

457
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,260
It can be something like, I
want to reward

458
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,360
the engineers that are in my
office at 9 o'clock at

459
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,750
night every night with an ice
cold fresh smoothie.

460
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,460
This is actually a real
example.

461
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,131
I was frustrated our engineers
were

462
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:21,465
working really hard at square.

463
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:22,182
And, you know,

464
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,847
maybe 20% to 30% would stay
very late into evening, and

465
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,254
I wanted to serve, we were
ready to serve them dinner but

466
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,509
I wanted to give them
something cool to reward them,

467
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,200
and you could think about
alcohol, but

468
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,870
that's a little complicated.

469
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,820
So smoothies were probably a
little bit

470
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,510
better than the pizza, which
drains you of energy.

471
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,260
But nobody could get smoothies
in my office to show up at 9

472
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,770
o'clock sharp that were cold,
that tasted good and delivered

473
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,730
in the right place that
engineers would find them.

474
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,940
You'd think this is simple,
but

475
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,430
in fact, it like, took months
to get this right.

476
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,328
So then we had an in, we had
an intern start, and

477
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,371
I think on his second day,

478
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,699
I was explaining this problem
and

479
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,166
he, he said, well, I'll do it,
and I was like looking at and

480
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,272
I'm like there's no way.

481
00:16:57,272 --> 00:16:59,658
I've seen my office manager
fail, my assistant fail,

482
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,394
all who are actually pretty
good.

483
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:03,936
This just isn't going to
happen, and then long and

484
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,036
behold that night they show up
on time, cold, delivered to

485
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,888
the right place, and my first
instinct was great not,

486
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,820
not, nothing about the
smoothies.

487
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,183
But okay, now I can actually
give you something more

488
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,868
important and inconsequential
and complicated to do, and

489
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,962
that's what you actually want
to do with every

490
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:21,430
single employee every single
day is expand the scope of

491
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,139
their responsibilities until
it breaks and it will break.

492
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:27,112
Everybody like, I couldn't run
the world, like everybody has

493
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,698
like some level of complexity
that they can handle, and

494
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:32,009
what you want to do is keep
expanding it until you see

495
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,869
where it breaks and that's the
role that they should stay in,

496
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:36,650
that level of sophistication.

497
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,830
But some people will surprise
you,

498
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,370
there will be people who you
don't expect without,

499
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,740
with different backgrounds,
without a lot of experience

500
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,100
that just can handle
enormously complicated tasks,

501
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,930
and so keep testing that and
pushing the envelope.

502
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,050
The other signal to look for

503
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,000
is once you've hired someone
is this,

504
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,590
with an open office just watch
who goes up to other people's

505
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,860
desks, particularly people
that they don't report to.

506
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,515
If people start going to your
desk,

507
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,540
someone individual employee's
desk and

508
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,490
they don't report to them.

509
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,660
It's a sign that they believe
that,

510
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,100
that person can help them.

511
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,490
So if you see that
consistently,

512
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,550
those are your barrels.

513
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,260
Just promote them,

514
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,150
give them more opportunity as
fast as you can.

515
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,310
The other question everybody
asks about people is,

516
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,470
when do you hire somebody
above somebody?

517
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,180
And when do you sort of mentor
somebody or

518
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,846
when do you need to replace
somebody?

519
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:21,510
And the way, the way to think
about this is

520
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,100
every company has its own
growth rate and

521
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,960
every individual has its own
growth rate.

522
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,780
So some companies that are
very successful,

523
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,880
let's say LinkedIn.

524
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,370
LinkedIn was always a very
linear company,

525
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,810
it never went like this.

526
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,640
So for example I joined
LinkedIn 18 months after we

527
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,150
launched and we had only 1.5
million users which in

528
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,960
a social product is very small
in number and
