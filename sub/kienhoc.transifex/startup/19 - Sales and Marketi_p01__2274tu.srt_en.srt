1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,953
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHAh6WKBgiE
Okay, great.

2
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:05,895
So okay, great, thanks for
having me.

3
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:09,024
So, my name's Tyler I'm the
CEO of Clever and

4
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:11,760
what I want to talk today is
about sales.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,030
And I've a little bit of
insight into this I graduated

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,970
college, I actually studied
math and

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,890
statistics, probably like some
of you here in this room.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,590
And thought I was destined for
this world of, finance.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,060
I was about to go start at a
hedge fund.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,350
And at the last second, a
friend of mine roped me in to

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,370
join his startup, and asked me
to do sales there, which was

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,190
something that I knew nothing
about, and so, had to

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,730
figure out on the fly, and
spent a couple of years there,

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,710
figuring out sales for this
very early stage company.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,010
And then, when it came to
start Clever, you know,

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,950
we started Clever, and I did
it with two co-founders who

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,450
are very technical, and one
very product-oriented, and

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,410
we wanted to build this
product for schools, and I

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,730
thought that experience would
have no relevancy whatsoever.

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,335
But it turns out that some of
the things that I picked up at

21
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,860
the, this previous job, where
it was figuring out sales,

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,270
have been huge parts of what's
made Clever grow so

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,600
quickly today.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,330
Quick background on Clever, we
build software for schools.

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,090
We are an app platform used by
developers and

26
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,610
it's used today by about one
in five schools in America.

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,160
And we started it about two
years ago.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,520
And so sales have been a be,
key piece of that, and

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,130
I want to use this time to
just share some of

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,630
the things that have worked
for me along the way.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,050
Of course, there's a million
ways to do this,

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,760
so you'll find what works for
you.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,520
So first I want to start about
how most,

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,160
how I used to perceive sales.

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,760
And a lot of people see sales
as having this, you know,

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,930
a lot of mystique around it.

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,250
You know, it's people who are
you know,

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,670
really articulate and
impossibly charming.

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,850
And they have these, you know,

40
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,310
killer closing lines that they
use.

41
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,330
And I think this is how I saw
sales, and I think this is

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,680
how a lot of founders I talked
to see sales, because they say

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,010
things to me like, you know,
we're just going to work on

44
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,530
the product and build a great
product, and then when it's

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,280
finally finished we're
going to hire the salespeople.

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,010
And what I've learned is that
hire the salespeople,

47
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,800
as a founder, the reality is
that's you.

48
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,310
And so you know, Paul Graham
likes to talk about how

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,480
there's two things you should
be doing at any point in

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,650
time when you're starting your
company.

51
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,280
You're either talking to your
users or

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,120
you're building your product.

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
And that talking to your users
part, that's selling.

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,470
And so.

55
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,940
You know, this is intimidating
to some people because

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,100
they're like, I've never done
sales, and I don't,

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,980
wouldn't even know where to
begin.

58
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,550
But it turns out that as a
founder,

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,940
you have some unique
advantages that make it,

60
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,150
possible for you to be really,
really good at sales.

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,670
And one of those is your
passion for

62
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,040
the product, and what you're
building.

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,650
And the second is your
industry knowledge of what

64
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,660
your, of the industry and the
problem that you're solving.

65
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,880
And those two things actually
totally trump sales experience

66
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,500
from what I've seen.

67
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,210
So, this is actually my
cofounder, doing sales.

68
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,280
This is what sales,

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,380
looks like in the very early
stage of a startup.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,280
It's not Don Draper.

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,550
It's a lot of calls like
these.

72
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,450
But this is something that
even as

73
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,440
a founder who's never done it
before, it's very easy to do,

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,556
but you have to commit
yourself.

75
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:14,709
And what we did at Clever was
we dedicated one founder,

76
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,536
which was me, to peel off and
say,

77
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:19,814
okay, Tyler you're going to go
figure this out and and work

78
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:23,116
on this full time because it's
so important to our business.

79
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,344
So, couple things that I've
picked up about sales along

80
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,160
the way and in, in trying to
figure this out.

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,140
You know, the first thing that
everybody knows about sales is

82
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,230
they say, okay, it's a funnel.

83
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,830
And you have these different
stages of funnels and you, of,

84
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,320
of the funnel and you move
your customers through it.

85
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,570
Pretty common categories.

86
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,550
There's this prospecting
category where

87
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,950
you're trying to figure out
who's even interested.

88
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,900
Then you're having a lot of
conversations,

89
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,800
which is the second level of
the funnel.

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,540
Then you're finding out who's
really serious and

91
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,230
you want to close them and
sign the deal.

92
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,830
And then of course,

93
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,300
you're in the promised land
of, of revenue.

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,120
And what I thought would be
interesting would be to talk

95
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,110
about each of the stage, a
couple strategies that

96
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,640
we've used at Clever that
have, worked really well.

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,380
So that these aren't abstract
things but

98
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,308
things that, you know, you can
hopefully use at your startup.

99
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:14,321
So, prospecting.

100
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,030
So, prospecting is the process
of

101
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,290
figuring out who will even
take your call.

102
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,430
And you know, one of the
things that I

103
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,860
realized early on, so there's
this guy Everett Rogers who,

104
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,270
who's created this technology
life cycle adoption curve.

105
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,180
And he describes it as bell
curve where you've got you

106
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,280
know, your innovators and who
will try new things, and

107
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,490
you've got your early
adopters,

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,920
your mid-stage adopters, your
late adopters, your laggards.

109
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,850
And one of the things that was
really helpful for

110
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,018
me in understanding sales in
an early startup is he's

111
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,510
quantified the tail of this
bell curve and this part over

112
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,670
here, the innovators, those
are your potential customers.

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,090
And it might seem discouraging
that only 2.5% of companies

114
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,340
are your potential customers
that would even consider

115
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,090
buying from a startup that has
no users and no revenue.

116
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,090
But actually, I found just the
opposite.

117
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,440
I found it to be extremely
helpful to have this frame of

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
mind, because you realize,
when only 2.5% of companies

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,130
will even take your call or
consider using your product,

120
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,220
you realize what a numbers
game this becomes.

121
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,550
So if you want to reach that
2.5% and

122
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,170
you want to get some early
sales, you, you've,

123
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,490
if you're starting to do math,
you're hopefully starting to

124
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,710
realize you have to do a lot
of calling.

125
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,579
You have to do, talk to a lot
of people.

126
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,270
So early on in the early days
at Clever, this was my job.

127
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,080
You know, in the,

128
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,060
in the 2 months the first two
months of YC,

129
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,070
I reached out to over 400
companies trying to get them

130
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,390
to take a call and and talk to
us about what we're building.

131
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,630
There's, there's three ways
that I

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,960
have found most successful in,
in prospecting and

133
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
getting these people, one is
your personal network.

134
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,120
That's obvious.

135
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm not going to spend any
time there.

136
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,980
Another one is conferences,

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,100
which is surprising to a lot
of people, and then the one

138
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,730
that people are most familiar
with is cold email.

139
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,160
And when I say conferences,
this is what people think.

140
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,010
They think I'm talking about
CES or, you know,

141
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,420
E3 or something.

142
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,900
And actually, the kind of

143
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,960
conferences where sales happen
look more like this.

144
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,590
And we've got, we would in the
early days would go to a lot

145
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,980
of these because you've got to
where your users are.

146
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,450
And if they're, if you're
selling to CIOs and there

147
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,420
happens to be a gathering of
them at a hotel in Milwaukee,

148
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,750
guess what, that's probably
where you should be.

149
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,020
So we go to conferences like
these.

150
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,445
We get the attendee lists in
advance.

151
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,440
We email every single person
in advance, and, and try and

152
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,210
set up meetings so that when
we get there,

153
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,720
every single minute of that
trip was, was well spent.

154
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,900
And this was huge in Clever's
early days.

155
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,120
These, this was where we met
all of our earliest customers.

156
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,500
The second thing I mentioned
is cold email.

157
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,670
A lot of people don't know how
to write cold emails.

158
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,420
It's actually really easy, and
the key is not to write a lot.

159
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,410
Should be really concise.

160
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,560
This is an email template that
I used early on and

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,740
you're welcome to copy it, but
it's really short.

162
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,590
Here's who I am, here's what
I'm building, and

163
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,800
I'd love to talk to you about
this.

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,949
Could we find time tomorrow?

165
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,830
It's really easy and, and you
can customize this and

166
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,400
find out for

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,240
every business you want to
sell to who's the right person

168
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,750
to send it to and you can send
out quite a few of these.

169
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,810
So all right, that's
prospecting.

170
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,930
And the reason this is so
important is because you've

171
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,960
gotta build that first layer
of the funnel.

172
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,830
Then you get them to take your
call.

173
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,130
And this is another place
where a lot of

174
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,680
founders I think just have a
lot of

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,390
questions about what to
actually do.

176
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,900
And the biggest thing to take
away,

177
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,060
in fact if you only take away
one thing from this

178
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,220
presentation today, the number
one thing you should remember

179
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,960
is when you get them on the
phone, remember to shut up.

180
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,810
And that's really surprising
to people.

181
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,500
So many founders, when I help
them with

182
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,390
their first sales pitch, they
finally get somebody on

183
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,470
the phone who wants to talk to
them about their product.

184
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,310
And they're so proud of this
thing they've been

185
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,570
building for the last three
months that all they want to

186
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,270
do is get on the phone and
talk about every feature and

187
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,140
talk about all the different
things they can do and

188
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,570
talk about why it's the
greatest thing in the world.

189
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,130
And I have that temptation
too.

190
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,850
It's just part of being really
proud of something.

191
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,920
But it turns out that if you
watch the best salespeople,

192
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,620
like the best salespeople in
the world, the top 1%.

193
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,990
And you have a chance to
listen in on a call with some

194
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,030
of those people, like I have,

195
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,870
the most surprising thing is
how little talking they do.

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,020
In fact, I've seen calls where
the,

197
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,730
where the salesperson told me
their goal was to

198
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,550
only spend 30% of the call
talking, and

199
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,440
have 70% of the call the other
person.

200
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,660
And they would ask a lot of
questions.

201
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,670
They'd say things like,

202
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,780
why did you even agree to take
my call today?

203
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,070
This problem that we're
talking about solving for you,

204
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,059
how do you solve it today?

205
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,430
You know, what would your
ideal solution look like?

206
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,190
And they're not, they're not
doing the talking.

207
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,880
They're finding, they're doing
everything they can to find

208
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,660
out what this person needs,
and hopefully understand their

209
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,280
problem even better than they
do.

210
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,870
That's what really great sales
is and in fact this is

211
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,120
something I, I, I, I drill
into everybody at Clever.

212
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,730
It's a really important part
of sales and

213
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,950
there's actually now if any of
you use Uber Conference,

214
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,120
they have this amazing feature
where when you hang up

215
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,560
a call it sends you an email
automatically and tells you

216
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,270
how much you talked versus how
much the other person talked.

217
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,810
And looking at one of those
emails you know,

218
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,660
if someone doing sales at
Clever, I get one of those

219
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,080
emails, I can tell immediately
how likely the sale is

220
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,940
based on how much talking we
were doing.

221
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,380
So, you got all these people,
now you got on the phone,

222
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,440
do a lot of listening, really
understand their problem.

223
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,550
And then the other part of
this stage that surprises

224
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,460
a lot of people is follow up.

225
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,420
So here's a lot of different
steps that you

226
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,000
can imagine going through.

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,250
You know, emailing somebody,
not getting a response, and

228
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,430
emailing them back.

229
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,570
Calling them, leaving a voice
mail, having a pricing call.

230
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,360
You know, there's probably
like you know,

231
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,920
60 things up here on this
slide that could be steps for

232
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,640
closing a deal.

233
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,570
These actually aren't just
random things,

234
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,770
this is one deal that,

235
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,730
this was the second deal
Clever ever signed.

236
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,460
These are all the different
steps that we had to in

237
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,630
order to get this done.

238
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,650
And you can see there's a lot
of really embarrassing things

239
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,520
up there like I emailed
somebody and they didn't

240
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,480
respond and I emailed them
again and they didn't respond.

241
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,650
And then I emailed them again
and

242
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,610
this is from somebody who
wanted to buy our product.

243
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,255
Isn't that crazy?

244
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:21,658
Ana that surprises a lot of
people.

245
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:23,675
I see so many founders today
have a great call with

246
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,889
someone, they send an email,
they dont hear back and

247
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:28,017
they say, oh that person might
not be interested.

248
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,378
well, guess what,

249
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,670
this is what it looks like in
the best case and.

250
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,782
And so you really have to have
kind of,

251
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:38,148
this unhuman, unreasonable
willingness to follow up, and

252
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:39,600
drive things to closure.

253
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,030
Now, qualify with that with
one thing.

254
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,620
Which is to say, when you're
starting a company,

255
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,320
your time is extremely
valuable.

256
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,430
because it's your only
resource.

257
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,240
And, and you couldn't possibly
do this for

258
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
every single person who might
buy your product.

259
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,030
So your goal should be to get
people to a yes or

260
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,930
a no, as quickly as you can.

261
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,250
Where you die is if you have a
thousand maybes.

262
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,010
And sometimes I talk to
founders who say oh, yeah,

263
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,510
I have this great pipeline of
you know, a hundred people who

264
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,950
are, who have expressed
interest in our product.
