1009
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,230
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfnkM44Urs
Um, so this is just one
concrete example of where

1010
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,150
a tiny bit of extra work is
the difference between

1011
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,470
success and failure.

1012
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,760
And, when we talk to
successful founders they

1013
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,110
tell stories like this all
the time.

1014
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,150
You know, just outworking
their competitors by

1015
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,770
a little bit, was what made
them successful.

1016
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,530
Um, so you have to be really
intense, you know,

1017
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,000
this only comes from the
CEO,

1018
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,750
this only comes from the
founders.

1019
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,090
Uh, one of the biggest
advantages that

1020
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,450
startups have is execution
speed and

1021
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,240
you have to have this
relentless operating rhythm.

1022
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,590
Um, Facebook has this famous
that says, move fast and

1023
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,250
break things.

1024
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,300
Um, but at the same time,

1025
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,630
they manage to be obsessed
with quality.

1026
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,100
And this is why it's hard.

1027
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,280
It's easy to move fast or be
obsessed with quality.

1028
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,160
Um, the trick is

1029
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,570
that you have to do both at
a start up.

1030
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,280
Um, you need to have a
culture where

1031
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,520
people have very high
quality standards for

1032
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,870
everything the company does
but still move quickly.

1033
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,800
Ah, Apple Facebook and

1034
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Google have all done this
extremely well.

1035
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,810
It's not just about the
product um,

1036
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,200
it's about everything they
do.

1037
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,780
They move fast and they
break things and

1038
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,520
they're frugal in the right
places.

1039
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,390
But they care about quality
everywhere.

1040
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,430
Um, you know you don't buy
people shitty computers if

1041
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,110
you don't want them to write
shitty code.

1042
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,170
You really have to you do
have to

1043
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,640
set a quality bar that runs
through the entire company.

1044
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,880
Related to this is that you
have to be decisive.

1045
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,550
Um, indecisiveness is a
start up killer.

1046
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,570
Mediocre founders spend a
lot of time talking about

1047
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,930
grand plans but they never
quite make this decision.

1048
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,320
You know, they're, they're
talking about well I

1049
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,580
could do this thing that
sounds great or

1050
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,440
I could do this other thing.

1051
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,150
And they keep going back and
forth and they don't act.

1052
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,870
Now what you actually need
is this bias towards action.

1053
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:48,420
Um, the best founders work
on things that seem small,

1054
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,530
but they move really
quickly, uh,

1055
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,270
they get things done really
quickly.

1056
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,560
Every time you talk to the
best founders, they,

1057
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,980
they've got new things done.

1058
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,280
In fact, this is the one
thing that we learned

1059
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,120
best predicts success of
founders in YC.

1060
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,370
If every time we talk to a
team they've gotten new

1061
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,470
things done that's the best
predictor we have of

1062
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,180
the company will go on to be
successful.

1063
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,910
Part of this is that you can
do huge things by,

1064
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,490
in incremental pieces.

1065
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,620
If you just keep knocking
down

1066
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,320
small chunks one at a time.

1067
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,610
In an year you look back
you've done

1068
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,300
this amazing thing.

1069
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,740
On the other hand if you
disappear for an year.

1070
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,030
And you expect to come back
with something amazing all

1071
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,930
at once it usually never
happens.

1072
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,920
You have to pick these right
sized projects.

1073
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,880
You know even if you're
building this

1074
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,910
crazy synthetic biology
company.

1075
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,640
Um, most people would say
well I have to go away for

1076
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,970
an year, I can't do this
incrementally.

1077
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,378
There is almost always a way
to break it down,

1078
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:45,030
into smaller projects.

1079
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,190
Um, so speed is this huge
premium, right?

1080
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,200
The, the best founders
usually respond to email,

1081
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,340
the most quickly.

1082
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,630
Um, they make decisions the
most quickly.

1083
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,450
They're generally quick in
all these different ways.

1084
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,020
Um, and they just have this
do

1085
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,110
whatever it takes attitude.

1086
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,060
They also show up a lot.

1087
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,960
Um, they come to you know,
they come to

1088
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,490
meetings they come in they
meet us in person.

1089
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,980
Um, one piece of advice uh,
that I have.

1090
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,160
It's always worked for me is
that they get on planes in

1091
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,680
marginal situations.

1092
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,780
Um, how we doing on time?

1093
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,130
I'll tell a quick story
here.

1094
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,330
Uh, when I was running my
own company um,

1095
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,830
we found out that we were
about to lose a deal.

1096
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,580
And it was sort of this,
this critical deal from

1097
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,650
the first big customer in
the space.

1098
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,030
Uh, and it was gonna go to
this company that had

1099
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,050
been around for years before
we were.

1100
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,480
Um, and they had us, like,
all locked up.

1101
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,220
So we called.
We said,

1102
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,070
hey we have this better
product.

1103
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,820
You gotta meet with us.

1104
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,520
They said, you know what.

1105
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,780
We're signing this deal
tomorrow.

1106
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,590
Sorry.

1107
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,220
Um, we drove to the airport.

1108
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,140
We got on a plane.

1109
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,050
Um, we were at their office
at 6AM the next morning.

1110
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,010
We just sat there.

1111
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,980
They told us to go away.

1112
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,400
We just kept sitting there.

1113
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,110
Um, finally one of the
junior guys decided to

1114
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,110
meet with us.

1115
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,530
Um, finally after that,

1116
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,590
one of the senior guys
decided to meet with us.

1117
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,680
They ended up ripping up the
contract and

1118
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,560
sell their company.

1119
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,790
Um, and we closed the deal

1120
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,390
with them about a week
later.

1121
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,290
Uh, and I'm sure that had we
not gotten on a plane,

1122
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,020
had we not shown up in
person,

1123
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,710
that would not have worked
out.

1124
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,740
Um, and so you just sort of
like, you show up,

1125
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,380
you do these things, you
know.

1126
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,420
Uh, it's, when people say
get on planes in marginal

1127
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,400
situations they usually mean
it.

1128
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,130
Uh, well they don't usually
mean it literally but

1129
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,700
I think it's actually good
literal advice.

1130
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,040
Um, all right.

1131
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,570
>> Six minutes, so.

1132
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,830
>> I'll skip that part then.

1133
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,840
So, I mentioned this
momentum and growth earlier.

1134
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,390
Uh, once more, that momentum
and

1135
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,670
growth are the lifeblood of
startups.

1136
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,520
Um, this is the,

1137
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,300
probably in the top three
secrets to executing well.

1138
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,390
You want a company to be
winning all the time.

1139
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,440
If you ever take your foot
off the gas pedal,

1140
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,170
things will spiral out of
control, snowball downwards.

1141
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,930
Um, a winning team feels
good and keeps winning.

1142
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,190
A team that hasn't won in a
while gets demotivated and

1143
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,720
keeps losing.

1144
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,530
So always keep momentum is
this prime directive for

1145
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,770
managing a start up.

1146
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,950
Um, if I can only tell
founders one thing

1147
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,990
about how to, how to run a
company, it would be this.

1148
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,770
For most start,

1149
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,160
software startups, this
translates to keep growing.

1150
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,620
For hardware startups it
translates to don't let

1151
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,190
your ship date slip.

1152
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,280
Um, this is what we tell
people during YC,

1153
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,260
and they usually listen,
everything is good.

1154
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,780
Um, what happens after the
end of YC is

1155
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,160
that they get distracted on
other things.

1156
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,090
And then growth slows down.

1157
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,760
And somehow after that
happens,

1158
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,950
people start getting unhappy
and quitting and

1159
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,330
then everything falls apart.

1160
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,780
It's hard to figure out

1161
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,640
a growth engine because most
companies grow in new ways.

1162
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,550
Um, but there is this thing
about if you

1163
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,260
built a good product, it
will grow.

1164
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,210
And so getting this good,
this product right at the

1165
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,580
beginning is the best way to
not lose momentum later.

1166
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,640
If you do lose momentum,

1167
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
most founders try to get it
back in the wrong way.

1168
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,300
They give these long
speeches about vision for

1169
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,840
the company and

1170
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,450
they try to rally the troops
with, with speeches.

1171
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,120
Um, but employees in a
company where momentum has

1172
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,750
sagged don't wanna hear
that.

1173
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,180
Um, you have to save the
vision speeches for

1174
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,010
when the company's winning.

1175
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,060
When you're not winning,

1176
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,820
you just have to get
momentum back in small wins.

1177
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,160
Um, a board member of mine
used to say that sales fix

1178
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,170
everything in a startup, and
that is really true.

1179
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,790
So you figure out where you
can get these small wins,

1180
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,310
and you get that done.

1181
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,330
And then you'll be amazed
how

1182
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:23,950
all the other problems in a
startup disappear.

1183
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,170
Uh, another thing that
you'll notice if you

1184
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,760
have momentum sag is that

1185
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,670
everyone starts disagreeing
about what to do.

1186
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,300
Fights come out when a
company loses momentum.

1187
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,810
Uh, and so a framework for
that that I think works is.

1188
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,470
That when there's
disagreement among the team

1189
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,830
about what to do, then you
ask your users and

1190
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:43,960
you do whatever your users
tell you.

1191
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,590
And you have to remind
people like, hey, stuffs not

1192
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,620
working right now we don't
actually hate each other.

1193
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,650
Um, we just need to get back
on track and

1194
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,300
everything will work.

1195
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,910
And if you just call it out,
if you just acknowledge that

1196
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,270
um, you'll find that things
will get way better.

1197
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,470
To use a Facebook example
again,

1198
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,120
when Facebook's growth
slowed in 2008

1199
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,090
Mark instituted a growth
group.

1200
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,610
They worked on very small
things to

1201
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,600
make Facebook real faster.

1202
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,330
Uh, all of these things by
themselves seemed really

1203
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,130
small, but they got the, the
curve of Facebook back up.

1204
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,400
Um, it quickly became the
most

1205
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,690
prestigious group there.

1206
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,280
Um, Marcus said that it's
been one of

1207
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,900
Facebook's best innovations.

1208
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,840
Um, according to friends of
mine that worked at

1209
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,990
Facebook at the time.

1210
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,010
It really turned around the
dynamic of the company.

1211
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,370
And went from this thing
where everyone was

1212
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,510
feeling bad and

1213
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,790
the momentum was gone, back
to a place that was winning.

1214
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,270
So a good way to to keep
momentum is to

1215
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,730
establish an operating
rhythm in the company early.

1216
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,020
Where you ship product and

1217
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,220
lauch new features on this
regular basis.

1218
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,990
Uh, where you're reviewing
metrics you know,

1219
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,790
every week with the entire
company.

1220
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:46,800
Uh, this is actually one of

1221
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,068
the best things your board
can do for you.

1222
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:51,740
Um, boards add value to

1223
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,810
business strategy only
rarely.

1224
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:54,540
Um, but

1225
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,390
very frequently, you can use
them as a forcing function,

1226
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,171
to get the company to care
about metrics,

1227
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:03,454
and milestones.

1228
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:05,750
Um, one thing that often
disrupts momentum and

1229
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,920
really shouldn't is
competitors.

1230
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,130
Competitors making noise in
the press, I think,

1231
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,070
probably crushes a company's
momentum more often than

1232
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,910
any other external factor.

1233
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,720
Um, so here's a good rule of
thumb.

1234
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,040
Don't worry about a
competitor at all.

1235
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,700
Um, until they're actually
leaving you with a real,

1236
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,180
shipped product.

1237
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,080
Uh, press releases are
easier to write than code,

1238
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,730
um, and that is still easier
than making a great product.

1239
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,800
So remind your company of
this, and don't, this is

1240
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,480
sort of a founders rule, is
not to let the company get

1241
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,340
down because of the
competitors and the press.

1242
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,130
Um, this great quote from
Henry Ford that I love.

1243
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,811
The competitor to be feared
is

1244
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:45,038
one who never bothers about
you at all.

1245
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:46,019
But goes on making his own

1246
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:47,900
business better all the
time.

1247
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,910
These are almost never the
companies that put out

1248
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,660
a lot of press releases, and
they bum people out.

1249
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,640
Should we move on to this
section...

1250
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,170
You know what, we'll cover
this in a later lecture.

1251
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,710
I will talk about, uh,

1252
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,220
finance dealmaking and
distribution.

1253
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,165
Are there any questions?

1254
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:09,162
Okay, so on Tuesday, Paul
Graham is going to speak.

1255
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:09,875
See you then.

1256
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,770
Thank you.
