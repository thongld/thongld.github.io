246
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk
And if you're talking to
college students,

247
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,790
as a consumer.

248
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,000
the, you're going to get a lot
out of students,

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,140
about, what their current note
taking habits are.

250
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,070
And, you know, what they would
be excited about.

251
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,330
One of the problems with
selling things to

252
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,890
college students, is that,
college students don't

253
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,460
actually spend very much
money.

254
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,470
it's, it's really hard to get
you guys to open your wallets.

255
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,960
Especially, if you want.

256
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,510
Them to pay for a
school-related thing.

257
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,217
And if you don't even want to
buy text books,

258
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,663
right, I think you probably,
probably all use or

259
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,178
that you know, borrow it from
your friend or whatever.

260
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,028
And so one of the like,

261
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,730
one of the things that I think
you'd be missing if you go

262
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,132
after just the students,
right, is you want to.

263
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,028
Figure out who,

264
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:36,236
who is the most important
person to this, to this app.

265
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,220
And if you're actually in a
note-taking app,

266
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,353
my guess is for colleges, the
people most likely to

267
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,783
actually buy a note-taking app
that you guys would used,

268
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,570
would be College IT.

269
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,550
Right, I mean, presumably for
most, for

270
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,630
the most part, if you want to
sell software to students,

271
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,520
like the people who have to
get

272
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,420
bought into that is usually
the school administrator.

273
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,620
So that would be one, that
would be one approach,

274
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,210
if you like thought that they
will.

275
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,100
You presumably go talk to the
College students and

276
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,800
you find out they don't
actually,

277
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,650
buy any note-taking software
right now at all.

278
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,130
I mean, likely.

279
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,940
It's possible they do in which
case I'm,

280
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,510
I'm complete wrong and this is
where you actually have to go

281
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,190
talk to the users but

282
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,160
you then have to try to maybe
try other, other groups right.

283
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
So I would talk to college,

284
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,460
I would talk to IT
administrators, as well.

285
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,160
Think that's another.

286
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
Area that's really promising.

287
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,490
You might lo, talk to parents.

288
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,520
Right?
Who, who,

289
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,210
who spends money on their
kids' Education and

290
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,730
is like willing to pull their
wallet out?

291
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,550
Like, the, you know, parents
of kids.

292
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,130
Parents of kids, who are
freshmen who are going off to

293
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,540
college for the first time.

294
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,310
You need this app to make your
kid productive so

295
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,880
that they don't fail out of
College.

296
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,010
and, and as I see a lot of
groups that are potential,

297
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,660
that aren't necessarily,

298
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,770
the obvious user, but who are
critical,

299
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,780
critical to your app's
success, potentially.

300
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,230
And when you, when you're at
the very beginning of

301
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,000
a startup like this, when
you're like,

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,130
you have this idea that you
think is awesome.

303
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,170
You want to have that broadest
group you possibly can.

304
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,150
You don't just want to talk to
one type of person and,

305
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,820
and, and learn that.

306
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,260
You want to get familiar with
the space.

307
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,200
You want to get familiar with
the various kinds of

308
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,420
people who be contributing.

309
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,321
All right.

310
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,382
So lets lets have somebody
come up and we're going to,

311
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:07,240
we're going to pretend we're
going to the senior interview.

312
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,390
So we're going to talk to a
college student and

313
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,290
try to find out what we should
build.

314
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,280
You know, what we should get
into this note-taking app.

315
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,761
So, so, some, another
volunteer please for, for

316
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:18,807
running an interview.

317
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:22,880
Yes.

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,400
All right, so hello.

319
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,850
>> Hi, I'm Stephanie.

320
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,980
>> Hi, Stephanie.
>> Nice to meet you.

321
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,920
>> Welcome, thank you for

322
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,298
agreeing to do this user
interview with us.

323
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:34,853
So I, I wanted to, hear from
you about you know,

324
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:37,310
what are your note-taking
habits.

325
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,900
How do you take notes today?

326
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,500
>> Sure, so I take notes in a
variety of ways.

327
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,870
I like to now because of speed
and efficiency and

328
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,330
just to come back to it later,
it's easier for

329
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,240
me to just take notes on my
lap top.

330
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,630
And so a lot of those notes
will be primarily, text based.

331
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,040
But in certain classes.

332
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,650
So, for example,

333
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,080
if I'm taking a History class,
most of it will be in text.

334
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,140
But if I'm taking it, taking a
Physics class for

335
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,880
example they're going to be
more complex diagrams,

336
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,470
different angles that I have
to draw and

337
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,270
so that's little harder work,
harder for me to-

338
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:05,900
>> What's-
>> Get.

339
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,020
>> What software do you use
for this stuff today?

340
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,320
>> I just do pen and paper for
that.

341
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,630
>> You do pen and paper, so
you do a combination.

342
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,996
You take notes with pen and
paper, you take notes-

343
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:12,713
>> Exactly.
>> With your

344
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,480
computer sometimes.

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,270
>> Yeah.
>> And when you take notes

346
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,340
with when you take all these
notes, again it's like,

347
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,110
do you actually review them?

348
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,610
Like, do you, be honest, do
you actually go back and

349
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,910
actually ever look at these
notes?

350
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,790
>> The pen and paper not so
much.

351
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,110
But yes to the software-based,
because it's more easy to

352
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,170
access and it's easier for me
to, to share and collaborate

353
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,140
and maybe even merge notes
with classmates and friends.

354
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,330
>> So what do what do you

355
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,740
use to take notes today on
your computer?

356
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,040
Google Docs and Evernote.

357
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,645
>> Google Docs and Evernote?

358
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,145
>> Mm-hm.
>> And ,.

359
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:45,740
>> And.

360
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,330
>> Tell me more about

361
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,720
like why two things at the
same time.

362
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,430
>> So Evernote is easy, if I'm
trying to just collect it for

363
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,920
myself, I think.

364
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,150
And yes you can share, but I
think Google Docs for

365
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,720
me is easier to share and that
depends also if, you know,

366
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,970
a friend has already created a
folder.

367
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,010
For example on Google Docs and
I just have to add to that

368
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,790
folder if it's a group project
for example versus if it's for

369
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,530
my personal use I, I tend to
go more toward.

370
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,280
>> So it sounds like you do

371
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,870
a lot of note-taking
collaboration.

372
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,370
>> Yeah.
>> What-

373
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,633
>> I wish it was integrated

374
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,633
>> What tell me

375
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,310
more about that.

376
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,379
Like, like, do you take as,

377
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,060
do you want up taking most of
the notes, most of

378
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,140
the value of the notes out of
notes other people take?

379
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,790
Or is it mostly your own notes
you review at

380
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,400
the end of a semester?

381
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,490
How does that work?

382
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,820
>> It's mostly, mine because
I'm pretty picky about

383
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,970
the way I like things
organized.

384
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,730
like, design wise, or
formatting.

385
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,070
Even color, I'm really
particular with.

386
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,330
And, like, the font that we
use.

387
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,050
And that really affects the
way I study.

388
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,920
So, I tend to like, to like,
to like to personalize it,

389
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
even after I merge.

390
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,070
>> So, you, you pull in notes
from other people.

391
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,830
But then you merge them into,
into the main.

392
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,790
>> What works for me.

393
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,290
>> Right.

394
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,570
awesome.

395
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,300
And if you, if you have
Evernote notes and

396
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,085
you have Google Docs notes and
you have pen and paper notes.

397
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:04,380
>> Mm-hm,
>> Once the semester's over do

398
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,160
you ever go back to any of
that stuff or is it

399
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,070
like the quarter end, you guys
do have quarters here, right?

400
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,690
>> Yeah.
>> One the quarter's over

401
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,980
do you ever go back to any of
that stuff?

402
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,480
Do you ever?

403
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,880
>> For classes not so much but
if it's notes I've taken for

404
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,310
like talks like these, for
example, or

405
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,560
if it's like interview prep
that I'm doing.

406
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,320
I tend to go back because of
things that I like to kind of

407
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,120
keep fresh in my mind.

408
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,780
And to help me prep for, for
future things.

409
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,470
>> So that's interesting.

410
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,190
Tell more about that.

411
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,200
Like you take notes not just
in class?

412
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,090
>> Yeah, so I take notes to,
also to summarize main points.

413
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,830
So if it's like inspirational
quotes.

414
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,530
For example talks that I go to
like these.

415
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,470
And then like, maybe I'm going
to an event where I'm

416
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,590
actually going to meet someone
and it,

417
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,450
it helps to actually to think
about and

418
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,040
to remember and recall what we
shared at the time that,

419
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,290
you know, I attended the talk
or something.

420
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:50,970
>> Awesome.

421
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,040
All right.
Well, normally I'd

422
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,290
actually dig into a lot more
detail.

423
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,510
There's a huge amount of like,
open questions that

424
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,750
are still in my mind after
hearing that stuff.

425
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,140
Questions about, which people
do you collaborate with.

426
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,470
Questions about whether or

427
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,370
not you like, like what the
volume of notes are.

428
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,900
And like how, how long of, of
note-taking stuff.

429
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,810
Just sort of, digging in to

430
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,610
like what the current behavior
is.

431
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,722
But like in interest of time
and not like keeping everyone

432
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,658
here hearing about the
intricacies of one person's

433
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,790
note-taking habits forever
we're going to move on.

434
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,120
But thank you very much
Stephanie that was,

435
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,300
appreciate that.

436
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,270
So so that, that's like, that
kind of stuff,

437
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,960
you notice we're not talking
about the actual content of

438
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,800
the app at all.

439
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,430
Like, I'm not, I'm not,

440
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm not really interested in
features.

441
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,117
I don't really want to know
about what they,

442
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,750
the specific feature set in
Google Docs and Evernote.

443
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,030
I might start digging in a
little bit more into,

444
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,300
which features actually get
used.

445
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,960
Like if she's actively
collaborating.

446
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,230
You know is, how does that
work?

447
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,550
I heard some interesting
things about oh,

448
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,380
we, we use folders.

449
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,550
That's interesting to me.

450
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,660
But the main thing you're
trying to do when you're

451
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,610
running these first set of
interviews is not necessarily

452
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,860
get, like, questions about
like user flows and

453
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,590
like optimizing that, or
questions about

454
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,970
like the specifics of of, of
any of that stuff.

455
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,880
kind of can be distracting
because users think they

456
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,630
know what they want.

457
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,740
But like you, you get the you
get

458
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,850
the horseless carriage effect,
where you're, you're you're,

459
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,680
you're getting asked for a
faster horse instead of

460
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,630
trying to design the actual
real solution to the problem.

461
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,940
If you start asking people
about features, so

462
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,300
you want to stay as far away
from features as

463
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,950
possible because the the
things they tell you.

464
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,700
Wind up feeling, almost
overwhelmingly real.

465
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,050
When you have a real user
asking you for

466
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,332
a feature, it's almost, it's
very hard to say no to them.

467
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:32,440
Because here's a real person
who really has this problem,

468
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,380
and they, they're saying build
me this feature.

469
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,850
But as you start to talk to
lots of people and

470
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,880
really get a sense for what,
what their problems are, you

471
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,660
figure out if this is actually
a promising area or not.

472
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,166
And like, based on what I
heard there, it's like.

473
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,640
Starting from that interview,

474
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,988
I'm not necessarily positive
there is a problem or

475
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:50,773
there's at least there's a,
there's a big enough problem

476
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:53,515
that it's worth building a
whole new product for.

477
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:59,820
Because I didn't hear a lot of
like things were were were.

478
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,710
There was a, a big blocker, or
there was something really

479
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,840
wrong with the way it, the way
it was working.

480
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,280
Unless I had some big idea I
would take that as,

481
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,412
you know, maybe a negative
sign.

482
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,797
But it doesn't necessarily
mean that you can't,

483
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:14,463
you can't move forward and
keep talking to more people.

484
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,147
Because just because you talk
to the first person and

485
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,256
you don't get anything out of
it,

486
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,813
doesn't mean there's not going
to be.

487
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:21,340
A ton more people, who
actually have a problem.

488
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,500
And you, once you talk to
about six, seven,

489
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,280
eight people you're usually
about done.

490
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,890
It's unlikely you're going to
discover a bunch of
