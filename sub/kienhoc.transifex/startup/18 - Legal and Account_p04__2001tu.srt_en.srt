826
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,890
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHzvmyMJEK4
they'll not really have any
say in the day to day running

827
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:05,770
of the company or their
strategy going forward.

828
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,186
And a contractor will sign a
consulting agreement, and

829
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,931
when the company pays them,

830
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:14,710
the company doesn't withhold
any taxes on their behalf, and

831
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,852
that's on the responsibility
of the individual.

832
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,721
But at the end of the year,
the company will

833
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:24,789
provide what's called a form
1099 to the individual and

834
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:27,578
also a copy to the IRS which
they'll use to

835
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,150
prepare their personal tax
returns.

836
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,746
The opposite side of this is,

837
00:37:33,746 --> 00:37:36,560
is an employee, and an
employee will

838
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,520
also sign some form of IP
assignment agreement.

839
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,550
But when the company pays
them,

840
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,510
the company will withhold tax,
taxes from their salary, and

841
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,050
then the company is
responsible for

842
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,900
paying those taxes over to the
relevant State and

843
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,090
Federal authorities.

844
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,570
And at the end of the year the
employee receives what,

845
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,020
a W-2 form, which will then
get used to prepare their

846
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,149
personal tax returns.

847
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,750
So, as Carolina said, the
founders need to be paid so

848
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,160
do employees, it isn't enough
to just say well I'm

849
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
paying them in stock so that
can be,

850
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,810
that can be their, their
compensation,

851
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,730
and they need to be paid at
least minimum wage.

852
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,182
So, in San Francisco which
actually has a slightly

853
00:38:20,182 --> 00:38:23,312
higher minimum wage than, than
California as

854
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:27,081
a whole that works out to
about $2000 a month, so,

855
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:31,037
you know, it's not a huge
amount, but it, it can add up.

856
00:38:31,037 --> 00:38:34,196
There's also another couple of
things that you need to be,

857
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:37,750
you need to make sure that you
have, if you have employees.

858
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,170
So, the first thing is that
you're required to

859
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,030
have workers' compensation
insurance, and

860
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,300
especially if you're in New
York

861
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,850
where the New York authorities
that look after this will send

862
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,400
really threatening letters
saying you owe $50,000 in

863
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,550
fine because your one employee
that's being paid minimum wage

864
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,930
is not paid the $20 a month
workers compensation fees.

865
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,180
So it is really important that
you do, you do set that up,

866
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,150
and the other thing that's
very important is that you

867
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,630
do need to see proof that the
employee is authorized to work

868
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,670
in the U.S. you know, founders
are not payroll experts and

869
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,610
nobody expects you to be one
either.

870
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,480
This is all just about the
basics, but

871
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,890
what that does mean is that
you absolutely must use

872
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,640
a payroll service provider who
will,

873
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,550
who will be able to look out
after this for you,.

874
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,260
And services like Zen Payroll
are again set up, they're

875
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,190
focused on start ups and they
help you get this set up in

876
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,160
the easiest way possible, so
that again you can go back and

877
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,730
concentrate on, on what you do
best.

878
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,940
And in the example that
Caroline gave just a few

879
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,790
minutes ago, if that company
had actually set themselves up

880
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,790
with a payroll service
provider,

881
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,500
all of that heartache would
have gone away because it

882
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,580
would all of just been looked
after for them.

883
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,330
They were trying to save money
by not doing it and

884
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,110
look where it got them.

885
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,390
So that's, that's really the
key thing,

886
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,560
use, use a payroll service
provider and

887
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,140
make sure that you understand
the basics of employment.

888
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,936
>> We're running short on
time.

889
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,234
Yeah okay, so

890
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:12,730
I can breeze really fast
firing employees slide and

891
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,560
then should, or should we cut
it off now for questions?

892
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,420
What?

893
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,550
>> Why don't we do firings
real fast?

894
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,480
>> Okay.

895
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,620
Okay.

896
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,570
Okay, so somebody at YC once
said you're not

897
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,410
a real founder until you've
had to fire somebody.

898
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,210
Why is that?

899
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,510
Because firing people is
really hard.

900
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,400
It's hard for a lot of reasons
including because

901
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,120
founders tend to hire their
friends.

902
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,710
They tend to hire former
coworkers, or

903
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,890
they just get really close to
their

904
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,120
employees because working in a
startup is really intense.

905
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,420
But in every company there is
going to

906
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,620
be an employee who doesn't
work out.

907
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,340
And firing a founder, sorry,
firing this employee

908
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,380
makes a founder a real
professional because he or

909
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,540
she has to do what is right
for

910
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,300
the company instead is what is
easy.

911
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,570
So I have some best practices
for

912
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,710
how to fire someone number
one, fire quickly.

913
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,730
Don't let a bad employee
linger.

914
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,190
It's so easy to put off the
difficult conversation but

915
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,600
there is only downside to
procrastination.

916
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,300
If a toxic employee stays
around too

917
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,260
long, good employees may quit,
and if the employee's actually

918
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,500
screwing up the job, you may
lose business or users.

919
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,970
Number two, communicate
effectively.

920
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,900
Don't rationalize, don't make
excuses,

921
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,480
don't equivocate about why
you're firing the employee,

922
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,050
make clear, direct statements,
don't apologize.

923
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,400
Example, we're letting you go.

924
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,050
Not, I'm so sorry,

925
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,120
sales didn't take off this
quarter, blah, blah, blah.

926
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,060
Fire the employee face to face
and

927
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,200
ideally with a third party
present.

928
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,480
Number three, pay all wages
and

929
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,430
accrued vacation immediately.

930
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,940
This is a legal requirement.

931
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,350
We don't debate or negotiate
this.

932
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,260
Number four, cut off access to
digital systems.

933
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,032
Once an employee is out the
door, cut off physical and

934
00:41:56,032 --> 00:41:56,963
digital access.

935
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,276
Control information on,

936
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,610
in the cloud, change
passwords, et cetera.

937
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,048
We, we had a situation at YC
where one founder.

938
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:06,045
Had access to the company's
GitHub account and held

939
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:09,530
the password hostage when his
cofounders tried to fire him.

940
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,280
And number five,

941
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,410
if the terminated has any
investitures,

942
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,968
the company should repurchase
them right away.

943
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:20,710
So, the take-away here is that
is as surprising as this

944
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,690
may sound.

945
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,820
One of hallmarks of a really
effective start-up founder is

946
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,690
how well he or she handles
employee terminations.

947
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:29,920
okay.
So

948
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,160
then, we had this section that
we called legitimacy,

949
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,830
which actually going to, goes
into a little bit more about,.

950
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,430
You know, how to be, how to be
a real company.

951
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,030
How to be sort of a grown up
company.

952
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,436
And we can totally jettison-

953
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,597
>> Is this the last slide?

954
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,132
>>
>> No.

955
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,156
>> We have our take-aways-

956
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:48,913
>> Take away the last slide.

957
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:49,850
>> Take-aways.

958
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,711
>> Okay.
So, Chris,

959
00:42:50,711 --> 00:42:51,880
you want to read the
take-aways?

960
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,780
>> Okay, so, we've,

961
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,570
we've pretty much covered all
of these anyway.

962
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,530
But, you know, the basic,

963
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,330
the basic tenet to all of this
is, keep it simple.

964
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,750
Do all the standard stuff.

965
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,970
And keep it organized to

966
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,150
make sure you know what you're
doing.

967
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,470
Equity ownership is really
important.

968
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,520
So make sure that you're
thinking about the future

969
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,890
rather the three months of the
history of the company.

970
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,550
A stock doesn't buy itself, so

971
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,800
again, make sure you do the
paperwork for that.

972
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,460
Make sure that you actually
know about

973
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,510
the financing documents that
you're signing up to.

974
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,850
It's not enough to just say,
yeah, I'll take your 100k.

975
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,860
Make sure you actually know
those rights.

976
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,850
And you need to get paid.

977
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,930
You and the employees need to
be paid.

978
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,260
And then, everybody needs to
assign IP to the company.

979
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,538
Because if the company does
not own this IP,

980
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:41,270
there is no value in the
company.

981
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,780
If an employee must be fired,
then as Carolyn,

982
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,780
as Carolyn was saying, do it
quickly and professionally.

983
00:43:51,926 --> 00:43:53,047
The couple of things,

984
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,960
that we didn't mention, was
knowing your key metrics.

985
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,360
At any time, you should know
the cash position,

986
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,550
you should know your burn
rate,

987
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,884
you should know when that cash
is going to run out.

988
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:06,748
So that you can talk to your
investors, about that, and,

989
00:44:06,748 --> 00:44:07,280
you know.

990
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:12,140
A lot of running a company is
following the rules and

991
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,260
taking it seriously.

992
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,190
It's not all the glamorous
bits that we see in

993
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,380
all the movies and

994
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,890
TV shows, so you do have to
take that seriously.

995
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,064
>> Okay.

996
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:25,032
So, it was shorter when we did
it the first time.

997
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,696
>> That's right.

998
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:28,018
>> Sorry about that!

999
00:44:28,018 --> 00:44:28,568
>>
>> Sorry.

1000
00:44:28,568 --> 00:44:29,074
>> If you could get like,

1001
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:29,638
two questions in there?

1002
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,000
>> Sure.
>> Yep.

1003
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,868
How do you advise

1004
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,485
searching for an accountant?

1005
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:35,730
And when in the process do you
need them?

1006
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,910
>> So there's two.

1007
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,130
So, the question was how do
you advise searching for

1008
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,140
a, an accountant?

1009
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,053
And when do you.

1010
00:44:42,053 --> 00:44:44,050
When, at what point do you do
this?

1011
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,420
So, there's two different
things.

1012
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,690
There's a bookkeeper and
there's a CPA, an accountant.

1013
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,660
And generally, bookkeepers
will be the ones who

1014
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,110
can categorize all your
expenses.

1015
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,500
And CPAs are the ones that
will prepare you tax returns.

1016
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,550
In the very, very early days,
it's probably fine for

1017
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,970
the founders to just be able
to see the bank statements and

1018
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,720
to be able to see those
expenses coming out.

1019
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,120
But tax returns have to be
prepared annually.

1020
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,360
And so, at some point in that
first year of the company's

1021
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,610
life, some service is going to
need to be.

1022
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,570
Engaged to do that,

1023
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:21,050
because it's just not worth
the founder's time to do it.

1024
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,340
There are services available,

1025
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,690
like inDinero, which kind of
try to, to make things as

1026
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,000
effortless as possible from
the founder's point of view.

1027
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,860
So that kind of thing is quite
useful, but

1028
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,240
you do need to get a CPA at
some point.

1029
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,762
Because you need to

1030
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:37,570
file your annual tax returns
for the company.

1031
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,780
>> And how do you find one?

1032
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,110
>> Finding one is kind of
tough.

1033
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,620
Probably the best thing is
recommendations from people.

1034
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,680
With, with any kind of
specialist, a CPA or an

1035
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,430
account a lawyer, or anything
like that, it's always best to

1036
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,090
use people who are used to
dealing with startups.

1037
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,350
Again, not your, sort of, you
know, your aunt who lives in

1038
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:01,620
Minnesota and doesn't actually
know how startups work.

1039
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,283
So, probably recommendations
are the best way.

1040
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,820
Sure.

1041
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,090
>> Considering what's in a
budget for

1042
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,540
you know incorporating the
lawyer for

1043
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,880
getting legal advice for

1044
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,856
my first seed round and then
for hiring the first employee.

1045
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:21,100
Money for that
>> So,

1046
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,910
in terms of incorporation,
don't spend a dime on that.

1047
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,610
You can do that online.

1048
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,840
>> Well, I, actually, I'm
sorry.

1049
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,070
It does cost a little bit.

1050
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,220
>> It just costs, yes.

1051
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,940
>> Incorporating online using
a, a, a service like Clerky,

1052
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,090
which Kirsti mentioned, is
inexpensive,

1053
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,830
like in the hundreds, not in
the thousands.

1054
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,120
So you don't need a lawyer for
that part.

1055
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,380
When you actually need to hire
a lawyer is,

1056
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,280
it kind of depends on what
business you are starting, and

1057
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,680
how complicated it is in terms
of, you know,

1058
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,850
do you have a lot of privacy
policies, do you, is

1059
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,760
HIPA involved, I mean you can
imagine, there's like a ton.

1060
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,310
And so, and also when then you

1061
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,150
mention when you're raising
your seed around.

1062
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,070
Well, how much money are you
raising and

1063
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,540
who are the investors and

1064
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,600
what kind of terms are in the
term sheet?

1065
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,840
Sometimes that dictates
whether or

1066
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,480
not you need to get legal
council.

1067
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,745
>> And again, a service like
can help if you're just

1068
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:11,970
using very standard documents
for the fundraising.

1069
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,420
There are very basic, vanilla
fundraising documents so,

1070
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,470
you can use those.

1071
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,795
And again, they, they cost you
know, less,

1072
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,709
less than $100, I think, which
can save you some legal fees.

1073
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,610
One more question.

1074
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,950
>> Do you want to take?

1075
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:30,280
Should we go back over this
side?

1076
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,360
I'm going to ignore good luck.

1077
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,030
Let's go over here.

1078
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,150
>> Do you guys have any advice
or

1079
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,250
comment on the complexity that
comes with working with

1080
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,260
cryptocurrencies or
cryptoequities in particular?

1081
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,040
Like your fundraising, since
that's becoming more and

1082
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,160
more popular.

1083
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,930
Oh, wow.
That's a tough

1084
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,680
question to end with.

1085
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,470
yes.
There are,

1086
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,630
there are some issues.

1087
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,550
Often banks will struggle to
deal with,

1088
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,430
with companies that are
working cryptocurrencies.

1089
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,530
Because they haven't quite
figured out how to,

1090
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,520
to deal with it, and, and that
sort of thing yet.

1091
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,870
generally, a lot of it,

1092
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,110
it, it's, it's very
product-specific.

1093
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,510
It, it's not something that
kind of

1094
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:09,709
has real general advice
unfortunately.

1095
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:10,990
>> Okay.

1096
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:11,990
Thank you very much.

1097
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,490
>> You're welcome.
