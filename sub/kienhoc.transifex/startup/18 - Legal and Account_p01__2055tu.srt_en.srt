1
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:06,621
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHzvmyMJEK4
General consul.

2
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:08,010
>> Oops.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,260
>> Christine and Caroline.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,070
And they're going to talk
about finance and

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,400
legal mechanics for startups.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,460
This is certainly not the most
exciting of

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,630
the classes, sorry.

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,020
But if you get this right this
is probably the class that.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,990
So thank you very much for
coming, and yeah, go ahead.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,490
>> Okay.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,400
So like Sam said,

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,790
this lecture is about the
mechanics of start up.

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,850
And Kristi and I are going to
be talking about some of

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,385
the basic legal and accounting
issues that your

15
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:36,030
startup may face in the very
beginning.

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,840
I was watching Paul Graham's
video, and at one

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,510
point he says, founders don't
need to know the mechanics of

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,420
starting a startup.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,050
I thought, oh no,

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,520
that's exactly what Sam titled
this lecture.

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,020
>> Ha.

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,200
>> But what PT actually says
is that founders don't need to

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,730
know the mechanics in detail.

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,000
Because it's very dangerous
for

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,560
founders to get bogged down in
the details.

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,870
And that's exactly right.

27
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,390
And Kirsten,

28
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,520
I can't give you the details
in 45 minutes anyway.

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,850
So our goal here today is to
make sure that you

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,480
do know better than to form
your startup as a Florida LLC.

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,330
>> So, as Sam mentioned, we
are also

32
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,200
worrying this is going to be
pretty boring for you to

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,510
listen to an accountant and a
lawyer talking about this.

34
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,520
You know?
You've had some really

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,050
amazing founders talking about
really interesting things.

36
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,760
But like, like Sam said, you
know,

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,250
this is the kind of stuff that
if you know the basics you can

38
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,740
get yourself set up in the
right way of always paying.

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,130
Stop worrying about it and

40
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,380
then concentrate on what you
actually want to do.

41
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,850
Which is make your company a
success.

42
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,170
And so, you know,

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,380
we refer to this term startup
all the time.

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,730
And probably in the back of
your head,

45
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,640
you kind of know that by
startup we mean there has to

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,600
be some legal entity.

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,140
And that's, you know, kind of
separate legal entity.

48
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,860
We'll talk a little bit more
about how we

49
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,720
actually set that up and what
that means to you.

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,570
And you also probably know
that a startup will have

51
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,500
assets.

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,740
IP, inventions, other things.

53
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,400
And that the company needs to
protect those.

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,040
So we'll talk a little bit
more about that.

55
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,580
About how to raise money
hiring employees, and

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,790
entering into contracts.

57
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,820
So there's a few other things
that talk, that you need

58
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,840
to talk about whilst your
setting up your company,

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
which kind of ferrets out a
few issues amongst founders.

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,130
Things like who's going to be
in charge and

61
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,280
how much equity is everybody
going to own.

62
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,210
So those are really good
things to talk about too.

63
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,345
You know, we can switch
slides.

64
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,100
>> Uh-oh.
>> There we go.

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,600
>> Okay.

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,690
This is us.

67
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,610
Kirsti has the calculator.

68
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,310
I have like, the geriatric
glasses,

69
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,350
which is actually pretty fair.

70
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay, so

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,160
the first thing we're going to
talk about is formation.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,260
Kirsti actually just mentioned
that.

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,260
Your startup is going to be a
separate legal entity.

74
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,280
And the, and you guys probably
already know this, but the

75
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,250
primary purpose for forming a
separate legal entity is

76
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,110
to protect yourselves from
personal liability.

77
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,600
And what that means is, if
you're company ever gets sued

78
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,410
you know, it can't, it's not
your money in your

79
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,890
bank account that the, that
the person can take.

80
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,770
It's the corporations.

81
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,920
So that's why you form one.

82
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,090
So then the question is, where
do you form one?

83
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,160
And theoretically you have 50
choices but

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,710
the easiest place is Delaware,
and

85
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,810
I'm sure you're all familiar
with that as well.

86
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,040
But Delaware is in

87
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,210
the business of forming
corporations.

88
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,230
The law there is very clear
and

89
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,390
very settled, it's the
standard.

90
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,730
The other thing is that
investors are very

91
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,530
comfortable with Delaware.

92
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,980
They already invest in
companies that

93
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,970
are Delaware corporations.

94
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,500
Most of

95
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,080
their investments are probably
Delaware corporations.

96
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,730
So if you are also a Delaware
corporation then

97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,320
everything just becomes much
more simple, right?

98
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,470
There's less diligence for the
investor to do.

99
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,760
You don't have to have a
conversation about whether or

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,850
not to reincorporate your

101
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,410
Washington company into
Delaware.

102
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,000
So there's a reason that so
many companies do it.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,630
It's standard.

104
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,430
It's familiar.

105
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,200
So I'll tell you a story.

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,430
We had a company at YC about
two years ago,

107
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,580
that was originally formed as
an LLC in a state that I'll,

108
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,920
that I'll say, Connecticut.

109
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,080
The founders had some lawyer
friends there who said,

110
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,730
this is the right way to do
it.

111
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,400
And when they came to

112
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,630
YC we said you guys need to
convert to Delaware.

113
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,795
So the lawyers in Connecticut
did the conversion

114
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,910
paperwork and unfortunately
they didn't do it right.

115
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,610
They made a very simple
mistake but

116
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,940
it was a very crucial mistake.

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,760
The company was recently
raising money.

118
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,210
Like a lot a lot of money and
this mistake was uncovered.

119
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,030
That the basically the mistake
was this company thought it

120
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,180
was a Delaware corporation for
a couple years, but

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,870
in fact it was still a
Connecticut LLC.

122
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,610
And I'll just say this four
different law

123
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,020
firms were needed to figure
that one out.

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,860
Two in Delaware one in
Connecticut,

125
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,305
one here in the Silicon Valley
and the bill right now is at

126
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:59,320
$500,000, for a conversion
mistake.

127
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
So, so what's the takeaway
here, pretty simple.

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Keep it really simple and
familiar for yourself.

129
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,250
The reason we incorporate all
companies the same way at

130
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,140
Y Combinator is because it's
easy.

131
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,170
So don't get fancy.

132
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,540
Just save yourself some time
and money.

133
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,330
>> Okay.
So once you've decided that

134
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,180
you're going to be a Delaware
corporation,

135
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,540
how do you actually set that
up?

136
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,890
And it requires a few
different steps, but

137
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,610
the first one is actually
really easy.

138
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,840
You literally just fax two
pieces of paper into

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,280
Delaware saying, we're
going to set up a corporation.

140
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,160
All that does though is create
a shell of a company.

141
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,940
It doesn't actually do
anything within the company.

142
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,790
So after that,

143
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,550
you then need to complete a
set of documents that

144
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,500
among other things approve the
bylaws of the company.

145
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,870
It creates a board of
directors,

146
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,980
it creates offices of the
company.

147
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,110
Delaware requires that
somebody has the title of

148
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,510
CEO or president, and of
secretary.

149
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,990
So also at this point,

150
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,730
you need to complete documents
that assign any inventions or

151
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,380
any code or anything that you
as an individual create,

152
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,520
so that the company actually
owns that.

153
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,500
And remember at this point,
it's,

154
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,550
it's a really good thing to
think about.

155
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,510
You as founders have to

156
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,520
think about things in two
different ways.

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,280
You always have to be
thinking,

158
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,250
am I doing this as an
individual?

159
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,080
As me?

160
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,600
Or am I doing this on behalf
of the company,

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,260
which is a separate entity.

162
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,020
So you have to maintain that
split in

163
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,760
your mind going through all of
this.

164
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,260
And we'll talk more about
where that comes in

165
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,980
a little bit later.

166
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,090
So there are services that can
help you get incorporated,

167
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,980
of course you can use a law
firm but there are also

168
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,540
other online services that
help, and the one we often use

169
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,620
with a lot of the YC companies
is call Clearkie Clearkie.com.

170
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,610
And they are set up so

171
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,650
that all the standard, basic
documents are used and

172
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,530
they get you set up in a very
vanilla way.

173
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,270
So that you can just move on
and

174
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,590
keep, keep focusing on what
you need to do.

175
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,565
So a note on paperwork.

176
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,180
You're creating documents.

177
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,290
These are really important
documents that are going to be

178
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,390
affecting what the company
does, and what the company is.

179
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,960
So it's really, really
important that you

180
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,770
actually keep these signed
documents in a safe place.

181
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,260
And it sounds so basic, but we
get so

182
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,000
many founders coming to us
saying oh, I don't know.

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,250
These, these, some documents.

184
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,120
And they have no idea what
they are or where they are.

185
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,770
So really, really make sure
that you keep them in

186
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,430
a safe place.

187
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,360
And let's be, let's be honest,
this is not the glamorous part

188
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,210
of running a startup, you
know, filing documents.

189
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,890
But actually at

190
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,230
the times where this is
crucial are going to

191
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,050
be at really high stress times
in the startup's life.

192
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,460
It's likely to be if the
company's raising a big

193
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,590
series A round, or if the
company's being acquired.

194
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,760
The company will have to go
through due diligence, and

195
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,430
there will be lawyers asking
for all this stuff.

196
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,520
And if you don't have it and
you don't know where it is,

197
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,660
it's just making a really
stressful situation even

198
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,410
more stressful.

199
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,940
So really, the, you know, the
key thing here is,

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,470
like we say, keep it simple,
but

201
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,180
keep those documents in a safe
place and keep it organized.

202
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,830
It will make your life so much
easier.

203
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,750
>> Okay.
So now,

204
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,420
we're going to talk about
equity.

205
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,590
And we're going to touch on a
couple of

206
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,640
different things in this
section.

207
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,600
The first thing that

208
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,980
we're going to talk about is
equity allocation.

209
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,760
So what am I talking about
here?

210
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm talking about.

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,850
If your company stock is a
pie,

212
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,450
you're talking about how to
divide the pie and

213
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,280
you're talking about this with
your cofounders.

214
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,890
Why is this important?

215
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,630
Well if you're a solo founder,
this really isn't important.

216
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,770
But if you are a team of two
or

217
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,060
more than this issue is
absolutely critical.

218
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,650
So the first thing that you
need to know is that

219
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,350
execution had greater value
than the idea.

220
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,870
What do I mean by that?

221
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,130
A lot of founder teams give
way too much credit and

222
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,990
therefore a lot of the
company's equity to the person

223
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,040
who came up with the idea for
the company.

224
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,570
And ideas are obviously very
important but

225
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,330
they have zero value.

226
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,520
Who's ever heard of a billion
dollar payment for

227
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,280
just an idea.

228
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,860
So value is really created
when the whole founder team

229
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,160
works together to execute on
an idea.

230
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,780
And so you need to resist the
urge to

231
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,780
give a disproportionate amount
of stock to the founder who is

232
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,050
credited with coming up for
the idea for the company.

233
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,720
The next thing you want to
think about is, okay, so

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,620
how much stock, or

235
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,509
should the stock be allocated
equally among the founders?

236
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,250
And from our perspective, the
simple answer is probably yes.

237
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,300
Our mantra at Y Combinator is
that

238
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,870
stock allocation doesn't have
to be exactly equal, but

239
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,190
if it's very disproportionate,
that's a huge red flag for us.

240
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,280
We wonder what conversation is
not happening in,

241
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,200
among the founder team when
the ownership isn't equal.

242
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,990
For example, is one founder
secretly thinking that this

243
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,720
whole startup thing is
temporary?

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,390
Is one founder over inflating
the work that he or

245
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,680
she has already done on the
company or

246
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,900
over inflating his or her
education or prior experience?

247
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,950
Do the founders really trust
each other and have they

248
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,690
been honest with each other
about their expectations for

249
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,970
this startup and for the
future?

250
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,000
So when ownership is
disproportionate,

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,830
what we worry about is

252
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,697
that the founders are not in
sync with one another.

253
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,173
Thirdly it's really important
to look forward in

254
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,979
the startup and now backwards.

255
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:29,997
Instead another way all the
founders in it 100%?

256
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,655
Are they in it for the long
haul?

257
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,737
If the expectation at your
startup is that each founder

258
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,886
is in it 100% and you're all
in it for the long haul,

259
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:41,968
then everything that happened
before the formation of

260
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:44,410
the company shouldn't matter.

261
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,830
It doesn't matter who thought
of the idea.

262
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,650
It doesn't matter who did the
coding, or

263
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,110
who built the prototype, or
which one has an MBA.

264
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,290
It will feel better to the
whole team if

265
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,430
the allocation is equal,

266
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,210
because the whole team is
necessary for execution.

267
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,030
So, here's the take away on
this point.

268
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,950
In the top YC companies, which
we call those, you know,

269
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,810
with the highest evaluations,

270
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,560
there are zero instances where
the founders have

271
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,920
had significantly
disproportionate equity split.

272
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,800
>> Alright, so you've had the
conversation about how to

273
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,790
split the equity.

274
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,410
But then what?

275
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,599
again, we talked to many
founders who
