258
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,690
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Dl8rZ6qwE
And I think there's a lot of
truth to that.

259
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,130
But for our particular first
ten people, the things we

260
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,350
sort of figured out that
seemed to be important were

261
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,760
they were also very genuine
and straight.

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,900
I think that actually
matters quite a lot in that

263
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,880
sort of they're people that
sort of that others want to

264
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,120
work with, that they're
people that others trust.

265
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,810
They sort of have an
intellectual honesty in

266
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,630
how they approach problems
and, and so forth.

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,650
They were people who

268
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,490
really liked getting things
finished.

269
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,290
There's a lot of people who

270
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,400
are really excited about
tons of things.

271
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,630
Only a subset of those are
actually excited about like

272
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,970
completing things.

273
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,160
You know, there's a lot of
talk about, for

274
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,940
example hiring people off
their GitHub resumes,

275
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,140
whatever, actually think
that doesn't quite ring,

276
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,620
kind of correct to me.

277
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,520
In the sense that place is a
large premium on sort of

278
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
lots of different things.

279
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,210
I think it's actually a
priori,

280
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,630
sort of much more
interesting to work with

281
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,750
someone who has spent two
years really investing in

282
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,882
going deep in a particular
area.

283
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:49,670
And then the third trait
they all seem to have in

284
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,460
common is they just sort of
cared a great deal.

285
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,300
Like, it was offensive to
them when something was

286
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,670
just a little bit off.

287
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,670
And kind of again,

288
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,590
in hindsight, there are all
these like crazy things we

289
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,010
used to do that I mean, do
in fact seem crazy like we

290
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,470
probably shouldn't have done
them,

291
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,620
but everyone was always like
well, was borderline insane

292
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,740
in sort of how much they
cared about tiny details.

293
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,340
Like we used to, like every
single API request that

294
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,540
ever generated an error went
to all of our inboxes and

295
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,760
phoned all of us.

296
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,830
Because it seems terrible to
ever have an error that

297
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
didn't go and

298
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,650
get a resolution from the
user standpoint.

299
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,440
Or we used to like copy
everyone else on

300
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,850
every outgoing email.

301
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,030
And we'd like point out
slight grammar or

302
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,070
spelling mistakes to each
other, because it's terrible

303
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,910
to ever send an email with a
spelling mistake.

304
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,890
So anyway those were the
three traits come

305
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,660
from that area.

306
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,466
A genuine, caring a great
deal.

307
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:51,471
And, so what was my second
one?

308
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,105
>> The other one.

309
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,442
>> Yeah so.

310
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,903
Sorry yes completing things
like list of three items.

311
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,730
>> Yeah, I'm only gonna say
I just don't think

312
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,410
there's any wrong place to
find people, so when I

313
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,080
look back at our first few
folks that we hired.

314
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,090
They came from all over the
place.

315
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,159
Like I put up ads on
Craigslist.

316
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,162
I went to random tech talks.

317
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,642
You know, we met people at,

318
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:18,190
we used to throw weekly
barbeques at the office.

319
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,490
It was like bring your own
food and drinks.

320
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,070
And then we would just talk
to folks.

321
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,360
I think every time I ever
went and

322
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,330
got coffee in Palo Alto.

323
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,060
Like one of you guys was
recruiting at

324
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,570
Coopa because their office
was like

325
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,605
strategically situated next
to the best coffee shop.

326
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:36,050
But I think that the really
good people generally,

327
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,390
they're generally doing
something else, and

328
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,910
so you have to go seek them
out,

329
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,394
rather than expecting that
they're gonna seek you out.

330
00:13:42,394 --> 00:13:45,000
Triple so, when no one's
ever heard of or

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,301
is using the product that
you're working on.

332
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:52,110
>> Yeah it's probably really
important to

333
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,140
have a great elevator pitch.

334
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,847
Not even for investors, but

335
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,979
just because everyone you
run into right now is maybe

336
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:03,730
six months, a year down the
road, a potential recruit.

337
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,280
And so, the right time to
have gotten them

338
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
excited about your company,
the right time for

339
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,620
them to have started
following us,

340
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,820
and be thinking about it if
they think about what

341
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,900
they're going to do next, is
as soon as you can start.

342
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,220
It's gonna take a very long
time to recruit people so to

343
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,190
being able to consistently
get people excited about

344
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,330
what you're doing will pay
back dividends later.

345
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,190
>> Maybe this is a little
tangential but John and

346
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,920
I were also chatting
yesterday afternoon sort of

347
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,850
like a bunch of our friends
have sort of

348
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,862
started companies right out
of school.

349
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:35,660
We were sort of thinking
about,

350
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,785
what seems to go wrong in
those companies.

351
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,685
And I think something,

352
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:43,010
that may be the most common
failure mode.

353
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,680
Since we said of doing
something kind of

354
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,940
overly niche, or overly sort
of specific and banded.

355
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,250
I think maybe it comes from
sort of like there's a major

356
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,930
shift in time horizon.

357
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,327
As you go from classes to
building a start-up.

358
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,543
Right?
A class kind of plays out in

359
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,193
a quarter or a semester or
whatever.

360
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:00,116
Whereas a start-up is like a
five or ten year thing.

361
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:03,163
And I think this is really
problematic because it's

362
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,379
actually quite hard to hire
people for

363
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,009
niche things, in that if you
tell somebody,

364
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:11,290
look we're going to build a
rocket that goes to Mars.

365
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,170
Like I mean that sounds
almost impossible, but

366
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,470
also sounds fucking awesome.

367
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,680
Right?
And so it's actually pretty

368
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,730
easy to convince people to
work on it.

369
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,740
Of course, if it's well, you
know,

370
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,050
we're going to build this, I
don't wanna single out any

371
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,710
particular idea, because
probably sound like I'm

372
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,090
picking some actual start up
that's doing it.

373
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,740
But you know, if you pick
something pretty narrow,

374
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,010
something that maybe kind of
inductively comes out of

375
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,450
the kinds of problems you
solve as part of a class

376
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,370
project, that's actually a
much harder effort.

377
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,410
>> One specific question
that has come up a lot is,

378
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,630
how as a relatively
inexperienced founder do

379
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,980
you identify who the really
great people are?

380
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,770
So, you know, you meet
people at these barbecues or

381
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,860
for your friends or
whatever, and

382
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,970
maybe you've worked with
them a little bit.

383
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,480
But what specifically did,

384
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,350
did you guys do in your
processes to identify like,

385
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,180
you know, what this person's
going to be really great?

386
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,550
Or when did you really get
it wrong?

387
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,950
But what have you learned
about how to

388
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,670
identify raw talent if you
can't just say, well they

389
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,270
worked at Google or
Facebook, they must be good?

390
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,550
>> Well, I mean, you'll
never

391
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,272
like 100% know obviously
until you work with folks.

392
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:09,260
Which is why the flip side
of it is, you know,

393
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,210
if someone you hired just
wasn't a good fit,

394
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,550
you owe it to the company
and

395
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,650
to them, to tell them how
they can improve, and

396
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,060
if they're not working out
to fire them.

397
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,207
But I think that the
generally,

398
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,350
the question of talent falls
into two big buckets.

399
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,320
Like, one is you have some
sense of

400
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,340
what makes them good at
their job, and

401
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,560
there are some areas where
you have taste in that area,

402
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,080
and there's some where you
don't.

403
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,780
And the ones where you

404
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,289
don't are actually much more
difficult.

405
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,160
So what we would do is, is
we would do a few things.

406
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,700
Like first,

407
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,650
before talking to anyone we
try to get a sense for like

408
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,290
what is really world class
in that discipline mean.

409
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,810
And this becomes very
important later,

410
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,140
when you're hiring things
like Head of Finance and

411
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,850
you don't anything about
finance.

412
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,930
Except what was contained in
like a library book you

413
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,800
got about like an
introduction to finance,

414
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,295
or head of marketing.

415
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:56,420
So, I always made it a habit
of, like, talking to

416
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,510
people that I knew de facto
were world class and

417
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,020
then asking them,

418
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,890
specifically, what are the
key traits or

419
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,030
characteristics that you
look for?

420
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,170
What are the questions that
you ask, and

421
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,820
how do you find them?

422
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,810
And if you're looking for

423
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,320
the next person that's as
good as you, like,

424
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,700
where are, where is that
person working right now,

425
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,290
and, like, what's, what's
her phone number?

426
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,280
I think that, like, learning
what good and bad is during

427
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,330
the interview process, is
extremely expensive.

428
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,580
It's an expensive use of
your time, and

429
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,140
it's an expensive use of
everyone else's time,

430
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,460
so precalibration of that
really matters.

431
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,950
And then, once you have
someone in, sort of,

432
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,470
the interview process,

433
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,012
you'll build the process
over time,

434
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:33,380
to both screen quality.

435
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,640
And so at Pinterest, you
know, we have

436
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
an evolving set of standard
questions that we're

437
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,440
always rotating through, and
we're always measuring,

438
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,360
are these good indicators or
bad indicators of quality?

439
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,900
But the other thing that the
questions are meant to do,

440
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,710
is they're supposed to give
a sense for,

441
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,740
is this the right place for

442
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,220
that person to come and
work?

443
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,800
And this to the point you
guys made about being very

444
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,250
transparent about what's
gonna be easy or hard.

445
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,460
Really great people wanna do
things that are hard,

446
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,530
they wanna solve tough
problems.

447
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,560
And so, there was a certain
brilliance in

448
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,250
Google setting out these
interview questions that

449
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,410
were thought to be really
difficult.

450
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,250
Because then people who like
solving really

451
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,280
difficult problems, they
come out and seek those.

452
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,780
I think it's really
important,

453
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,880
even as companies get
bigger,

454
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,870
that you don't whitewash the
risks.

455
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,120
I heard that PayPal, you'd
go in and

456
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,940
after interviewing with like
Peter Thiel and

457
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,780
Max Levchin, then they would
say by the way like Visa and

458
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,920
MasterCard wanna kill us,
and

459
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,140
we might be doing something
that's illegal.

460
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,220
But if you succeed, you'll
redefine payments.

461
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,410
Or when they were recruiting
for iPhone,

462
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,906
they didn't even tell people
what they were doing.

463
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:34,927
They were like you won't see
your families for

464
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,408
three years, but when you're
done,

465
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,970
your kid's kids will
remember what you built.

466
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,890
And I think that's a really
good thing in recruiting as

467
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,100
well that you're very
transparent about why you

468
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,950
think it's an amazing
opportunity, but

469
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,000
you lay out in gory detail
why it's gonna be hard.

470
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,090
And then the right people
select in, or

471
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,580
they select out of that
opportunity.

472
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,010
>> Evidence suggest it's
worth a lot of

473
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,980
people to see their kids,
though.

474
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,610
I feel like one thing you
have to do as you try to

475
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:12,340
identify talent is have the
confidence to interview for,

476
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,922
in a way that works for you.

477
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:17,412
I think you know, if you're,
say you're not,

478
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,410
the world's best engineer
and

479
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,850
you're trying to interview
engineering candidates.

480
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,220
I think it's tempting to try
to

481
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,880
color code what everyone
else does.

482
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
And you know, get them to
call it on white board.

483
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,750
And do other engineering,
interviewee things.

484
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,140
You know in the case of
Stripe,

485
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,990
hiring our first engineer.

486
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,730
We flew the guy out, and we
spent a weekend coding with

487
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,760
him, and you know looked
over his shoulder and

488
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,830
kind of, it was the only way
we could really tell and

489
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,070
get ourselves confident
that, that person was good.

490
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,720
And I think you can actually
extend that to other roles,

491
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,310
where again you're not an
expert, and

492
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,500
that you know I'm no
business development guru.

493
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,170
But when we interview people
for

494
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,360
business development roles,

495
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,962
we'll ask them to do a
project, you know?

496
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,780
Where they talk about how
they would

497
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,080
improve an existing
partnership that Stripe has.

498
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,810
Or which new partnerships
they would go out and do.

499
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,140
And again, you know,

500
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,520
even though it's not my
domain area, I am actually

501
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,390
confident enough that I can
judge those pretty well.

502
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,160
And I think people often
have this imposter syndrome

503
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,580
when it comes to
interviewing for roles.

504
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,135
Yeah.
I think a pretty specific,

505
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:18,483
just kind of just tactical
thing, and to do for

506
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,313
again the first 10 people,
is to work with them as much

507
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:23,620
as you can before committing
to hiring them.

508
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,370
I mean, once you

509
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,070
reach a certain scale it's
kind of impractical,

510
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,700
because it's a huge time
commitment on their side.

511
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,630
And ultimately I mean it
just would be unskilled,

512
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,590
would be expensive from your
side.

513
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,210
But it's really worth it

514
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,330
to get the first ten people
right.
