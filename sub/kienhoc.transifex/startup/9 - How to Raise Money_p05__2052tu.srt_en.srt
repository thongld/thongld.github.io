1069
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:15,200

such an incredible amount of
insight in your business.

1070
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,110
That you walk out of there
being like, man, I don't,

1071
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,980
even if these guys didn't
invest, that sort of hour

1072
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,470
that I spent with them was
such a great use of my time.

1073
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,120
I felt like I came out with
a much clearer picture of

1074
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,520
what I need to do and where
I need to go.

1075
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,400
And that's such a great
microcosm of what

1076
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,410
the next couple of years are
gonna be like.

1077
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,720
You know like, don't if you
feel like you would want

1078
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,410
this person really involved
in the company even if they

1079
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,990
didn't have like a checkbook
that they brought with them.

1080
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,395
And if not that's probably a
very bad sign.

1081
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:49,396
>> What's the constraint on
the V

1082
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:53,213
making accurate use of
angels and VCs?

1083
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:57,377
Time, money, or the lack of
company?

1084
00:40:57,377 --> 00:40:59,555
>> Well what's the
constraint on

1085
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:02,325
how many companies you guys
invest in?

1086
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:05,432
>> SV Angels has kinda
gotten comfortable with one

1087
00:41:05,432 --> 00:41:06,750
a week.

1088
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,780
You certainly can't do more
than that, and

1089
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,190
that's a staff of 13.

1090
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,590
So it's, it's really the
number of companies.

1091
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,100
>> Ron, if you had,

1092
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,160
if you all worked twice the
number of hours,

1093
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,860
would you invest in twice
the number of companies?

1094
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,320
>> I would advise against
that,

1095
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,540
I would rather just add
value,

1096
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,240
more value to the existing
companies.

1097
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,010
>> Maybe you could,

1098
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,795
I'll take the role of
questioner for a second.

1099
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:31,470
>> [LAUGHTER] Maybe you
could,

1100
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,150
could you talk a little bit
about conflict policy?

1101
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,970
>> Or not, or not conflict
policy.

1102
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,410
>> Well SV Angel actually
does

1103
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,610
have a written conflict
policy.

1104
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,100
But most, when we end up
with a conflict it's usually

1105
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,080
because one company has
morphed into another space.

1106
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,990
We don't normally,

1107
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,840
invest in companies that
have a direct conflict.

1108
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,580
If we do we will disclose it
to the other company,

1109
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,180
to both companies.

1110
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,410
And keep in mind at our
stage,

1111
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,210
we don't know the company's
project strategy anyway.

1112
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,670
We probably don't know
enough to disclose.

1113
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,600
But our conflict policy also
talks about

1114
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
this really important word,
which is trust.

1115
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,600
In other words,

1116
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,900
we're off to a bad start if
we don't trust each other.

1117
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,280
And, and with SV Angel, the
relationship between

1118
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,260
the founder and us, is based
on trust.

1119
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,939
And if somebody doesn't
trust us

1120
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:27,494
then they shouldn't, they
shouldn't work with us.

1121
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:29,210
>> Mark, would you invest in
companies?

1122
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,411
>> yeah.
So this is actually-

1123
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:32,200
So, let me go back to the
original question.

1124
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,830
I'll come back to that.

1125
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,320
So the original question is
this is the thing we

1126
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,580
talk about most often in our
firm.

1127
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,880
So this is kind of the,

1128
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,850
the question is at the heart
of I think how all venture

1129
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,690
capital operates which is a
question of constraints.

1130
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,320
So the big constraint on

1131
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,810
a top tier venture capital
firm the big

1132
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,859
constraint is the concept of
opportunity cost.

1133
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,910
So, it's the concept that
basically everything you

1134
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,280
do means that there are a
whole bunch of

1135
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,270
other things that you can't
do.

1136
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,160
And so, it's not so much the
cost.

1137
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,630
And, and we think about this
all the time.

1138
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,260
It's not so much the cost
of,

1139
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,230
we invest five million
dollars in a company, and

1140
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,470
the company goes wrong and
we lose the money.

1141
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,340
That's not really the loss
that we're worried about.

1142
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,866
Because the theory is will
have

1143
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:07,400
the winners that'll make up
for that in theory.

1144
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,700
The cost that we're worried
about,

1145
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,660
is, every investment we make
has,

1146
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,110
has two implications for how
we run the firm.

1147
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,570
Every investment we make,

1148
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,250
number one rules out
conflicts, and so, for

1149
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,740
sure our policy for sure on
venture and growth rounds,

1150
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,580
is that we don't invest in
conflicting companies.

1151
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,040
And so we only invest in one
company in a category.

1152
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,280
And, so, if we invest in
MySpace, and

1153
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,930
then Facebook comes along a
year later.

1154
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:28,620
Like, we're out.

1155
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,705
We can't do it, right?

1156
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:32,530
And so we basically lock,

1157
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,790
every investment we make
locks us out of a category.

1158
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,835
Right?
And, the nature, that's

1159
00:43:35,835 --> 00:43:37,566
a very complicated topic
when you're discussing these

1160
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:39,570
things internally in these
firms at first because.

1161
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,590
You only know the companies
that already exist right?

1162
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,090
You don't know the companies
that haven't even

1163
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,510
been founded yet right?

1164
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,660
And God help you had you
invested in you know,

1165
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,340
an early company that was
not gonna be the winner and

1166
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,560
you were locked out by the
time you know,

1167
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,250
the winner emerged three
years later and

1168
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,480
you just couldn't make the
investment.

1169
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,350
So that's one issue, is
conflict policy.

1170
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,840
The other issue is
opportunity cost.

1171
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,910
The time and bandwidth of
the general partners and so

1172
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,550
going back to the concept of
adding value,

1173
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,520
you know we're a firm
typical, typical firm we're

1174
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,880
fairly typical firm we've
eight general partners,

1175
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,060
each general partner can
maybe be on 10, 10 to 12

1176
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,030
boards in total if they're
completely fully loaded.

1177
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,450
So it's basically Warren
Buffet talks a lot

1178
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,860
about investing as you
basically want to think of

1179
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,390
it as a ticket that you have
a limited amount of

1180
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,630
holes you can punch and
every time you

1181
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,570
make an investment you punch
the hole.

1182
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,580
And when you're out of,

1183
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,260
when you're out of holes to
punch like you're done,

1184
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,300
you can't make any new
investments.

1185
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,360
And that's very much how
venture capital operates and

1186
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,530
so the way to think about is
every open board

1187
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,990
slot that one of our GPs has
at any given point in

1188
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,020
time is an asset of the firm
that can be

1189
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,720
deployed against an
opportunity.

1190
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,800
But every time we make an
investment it takes

1191
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,250
the number of slots that we
can punch down by one.

1192
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,232
So, it reduces the ability
for

1193
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:45,839
the firm to do new deals.

1194
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,153
And so every investment we

1195
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:49,722
make forecloses not just the
competitive set, but

1196
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:52,186
other deals where we will
simply run out of time.

1197
00:44:52,186 --> 00:44:54,889
And so, and this is sort of
a big thing of like well.

1198
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,137
This goes back to what I
said earlier.

1199
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:57,433
Like this company's pretty
good.

1200
00:44:57,433 --> 00:44:58,657
It seems fairly obvious that
it's going to

1201
00:44:58,657 --> 00:44:59,306
raise extra funding.

1202
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:00,155
Why didn't you fund it?

1203
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,238
Well, on its own if we

1204
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:03,890
had unlimited capacity we
probably would have.

1205
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,360
Like it'll probably make
money.

1206
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,486
But relative to getting
blocked out of

1207
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:08,814
the competitive set and

1208
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:11,339
relative not having that
open seat for a, for

1209
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,205
an even better opportunity
we pass on that basis a lot.

1210
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:22,623
>> It's pretty widely agreed
that, that that's it's

1211
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:26,872
easier than ever to build an
MVP launched get traction.

1212
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:30,263
Same time we know that there
are CPOs that have been

1213
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:33,745
pre-MVP or even pre-launch
and pre-traction.

1214
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:36,602
So in those instances where
you do a seed round with

1215
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:39,050
a company either doesn't
have a or

1216
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,519
doesn't have a launch
impressive traction.

1217
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,282
What do those deals look
like and

1218
00:45:44,282 --> 00:45:46,511
what do you make that
judgment based on?

1219
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,667
What convinces you to invest
with product with and

1220
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,290
no traction?

1221
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,200
>> What would convince us,

1222
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,370
which is what usually
convinces us,

1223
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:58,830
is the founder and their
team themselves.

1224
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,700
So we invest in people
first.

1225
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,400
Not necessarily the product
idea.

1226
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,070
The product ideas tend to
morph a lot.

1227
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,030
So we will invest in, in the
team first.

1228
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:13,420
If it's, if it's pre-users,
the valuation is gonna tend

1229
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,980
to be corresponding lower
unless one of the founders,

1230
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,960
you know, has a, a success
track record.

1231
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,720
>> Yeah, for us it's almost
always, if there's nothing

1232
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,390
at the time of investment,
then it's almost, other than

1233
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,870
a plan it's almost always
the founder who we've worked

1234
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,580
with before or a founder
who's very well known.

1235
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,600
By the way the other thing
worth highlighting is,

1236
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,210
you kind of, in these
conversations,

1237
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,160
in all these conversations,
you kinda, the default

1238
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,950
assumptions is that we're
all starter web companies or

1239
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,810
consumer mobile companies.

1240
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,440
There are, you know other
categories or companies,

1241
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,030
capital intensive is one
that's been brought up,

1242
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,310
but it's I'll just say for

1243
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:46,730
example, enterprise software
companies.

1244
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,650
Or enterprise these days
Saas, you know,

1245
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,690
application companies or
cloud companies.

1246
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,510
It's much more common that
there's no MVP right.

1247
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,110
It's much more common that
they're a cold start.

1248
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,110
And it's much more common
that they

1249
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,380
build a product in the A
round.

1250
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,550
Then there's no point to
have an MVP cuz

1251
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,690
the customer's not gonna buy
an MVP the customer actually

1252
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,210
needs the full product when
they first start using it.

1253
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,772
And so the company actually
needs to raise 5 or

1254
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:07,260
10 million dollars to get
the first product built.

1255
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,340
But in almost all those
cases that's gonna be

1256
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,810
a founder who's done it
before.

1257
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:20,613
I think we have time for one
more question.

1258
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:21,186
Yeah.
>> Could you talk

1259
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,495
about the ideal Boris
structure and

1260
00:47:22,495 --> 00:47:24,031
when do you think expect to
publish that?

1261
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:24,581
>> Yes, talk about the ideal
Boris structure.

1262
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:33,500
>> Gosh, I think So, so in
our board we're fortunate

1263
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,907
that we have, there's myself
and my cofounder, and a.

1264
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:40,600
Partner from Adruse and
Horowitz.

1265
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,160
Which I think probably
removes the fear.

1266
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,110
It probably creates a little
more trust cuz it sort of

1267
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,860
removes the fear that like,
you know, someone's going to

1268
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,380
come in and just like, fire
you arbitrarily because it's

1269
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,280
like, time for a big company
CEO.

1270
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,400
Kind of thing.
But I,

1271
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,880
in most cases I think if
you, if you trust,

1272
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,900
if you trust the people that
you're working with it,

1273
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,140
it shouldn't really be an
issue.

1274
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,100
Cuz there are so, there are
so few.

1275
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,610
I mean things almost never
come to like a board vote.

1276
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,190
And by the time that they do
it's like somethings deeply

1277
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,810
broken at that point anyway.

1278
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,330
and, and most of.

1279
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,760
And most of the power that
VCs have comes outside of

1280
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,720
the board structure, it's
protective covenants that

1281
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,620
are build into the financing
round so it's like you can't

1282
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,550
you know, take on debt, you
can't sell the company.

1283
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,610
There are certain things
that you

1284
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,870
can't do without them
agreeing to it anyway.

1285
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,450
So it's probably like less
of a big deal than people

1286
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,060
make it out to be.

1287
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,860
What I found, sort of,

1288
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,910
is, is that it seems to me
that, as a founder.

1289
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,690
If things are going well at
the company,

1290
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,130
you have sort of unlimited
power, vis a vis,

1291
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,240
your investors.

1292
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,320
Like, almost unlimited.

1293
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,110
Like, no matter what the
board structure is, and

1294
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,530
no matter what the covenants
are in the round.

1295
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,460
Like, if you say, listen, I
wanna do this, and

1296
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,010
I think this is what we need
to do.

1297
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,530
And even if it's, like, a
good investor or

1298
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,520
a bad investor.

1299
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,030
Even the bad investors will
be, like, you know?

1300
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,410
Like, let's, let's, let's
make it happen.

1301
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,100
Cuz they wanna like ride
this rocket ship with you.

1302
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,850
And when things are going
badly it does not

1303
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,520
matter what protections
you've built into

1304
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,950
the system for yourself.

1305
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,480
Like, you know, at the end
of the day, like,

1306
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,670
you need to go back to the
trough to get more money.

1307
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,010
And you know, if, if, like,
things aren't going well,

1308
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,970
like they're gonna have all,

1309
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,130
all of the cards in their
hand.

1310
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:17,520
>> And they're gonna get to
renegotiate all the terms.

1311
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,900
>> And, exactly they'll
change all the terms.

1312
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,810
>> This is what happens
actually when

1313
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,960
a company gets in dire
straights.

1314
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,840
Their it actually doesn't
matter what the terms, but

1315
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,210
at fire rounds they all get
renegotiated.

1316
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:25,790
>> This is I think

1317
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,300
the fundamental rule of
raising money.

1318
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,507
Other than never having down
turns is that if

1319
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:32,790
things are going well the
founder is in control and

1320
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,960
this company needs more
money and

1321
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,870
things going badly, if
investors are in control.

1322
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,110
>> I've been on boards for
20 years public and

1323
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,360
private, I have never been a
board vote that mattered.

1324
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,160
It's always been never,
never a vote.

1325
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,010
Many discussions, many
controversies, many issues.

1326
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,040
Never a vote.

1327
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,370
It's the decision has always
been clear by the end.

1328
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,780
And it's either by unanimous
or very close to unanimous.

1329
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,760
And so I think it is almost
all around the intangibles

1330
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,300
and almost not at all around
the details.

1331
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,092
>> Okay.
Thank you

1332
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:00,080
guys very much for coming in
today.

1333
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,766
>> Pleasure.
