1021
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI
you're working with great
partners,

1022
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,330
they're gonna wanna be
working really hard,

1023
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,410
they're gonna want you to be
working really hard uh, and

1024
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,890
again, you're gonna wanna
work really hard.

1025
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,680
So some some companies like
to tell the story about you

1026
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,890
can have your cake and eat
it too, you can have, like,

1027
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,900
four day week, work weeks
maybe if you're, if you're,

1028
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,790
Tim Ferris maybe you can
have a 12-hour work week.

1029
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,870
It's a really attractive
idea and

1030
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,780
it does work in a particular
instance.

1031
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,960
Which is if you wanna like
actually have a small

1032
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,410
business or go after a niche
market.

1033
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,500
Then you're a small business
entrepreneur.

1034
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,510
That makes total sense.

1035
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,040
But as soon as you get past
like two or

1036
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,610
three people uh, you really
need to step it up and, and

1037
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,489
be full time committed.

1038
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,740
cool.

1039
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,960
So, this is the big one this
is the, the one I

1040
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,600
hear the most especially
like candidates applying to

1041
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,670
a Asana they tell me, you
know, I,

1042
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,990
I'd really like to work for,
for

1043
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,150
a much smaller company, or
start my own because.

1044
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,180
Then I have a much bigger
slice of the pie,

1045
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,680
I'll have much more impact
on how that company does and

1046
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll have more equity so

1047
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,570
I'll make more money as
well.

1048
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,210
So let's examine when this
might be true.

1049
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,510
So I'll explain these tables
they're a little complex but

1050
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,640
let's focus on the left
first so these is,

1051
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,080
this is just explaining.

1052
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,240
Dropbox and Facebook.

1053
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,550
These are their current
valuations.

1054
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,970
And this is how much money
you might

1055
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,610
make as employee number 100
coming into these companies.

1056
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,620
Especially if you're like,
an experience,

1057
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,140
a relatively experienced
engineer, like,

1058
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,650
you have five years of, of
industry experience.

1059
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,370
You're pretty likely to

1060
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,080
have an offer that's around
10 basis points.

1061
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,140
So if you joined DropBox a
couple years ago,

1062
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,480
the upside you'd have
already locked in.

1063
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,560
As about ten million,

1064
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,170
there's plenty more growth
from there.

1065
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,370
If you leave the company if
you joined Facebook a couple

1066
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,040
years into its,

1067
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,910
its existence you made $200
million.

1068
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,463
This is a huge number.

1069
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:43,726
And if you.

1070
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,840
Even if you joined Facebook
as employee number 1,000.

1071
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,640
So you joined it in like
2009 you still

1072
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,930
made $20 million.

1073
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,350
That's a giant number.

1074
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,340
And that's how you should be
benchmarking when you're

1075
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,770
thinking about what might I
make as an entrepreneur.

1076
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,750
So moving over to the table
on the right uh,

1077
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,160
these are two theoretical
companies you might start.

1078
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,580
So Uber for Pet Sitting,
pretty good idea.

1079
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,600
If you're, if you're really
well suited to this,

1080
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,150
you might have, uh, a really
good shot at

1081
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,148
building a $100 million
company.

1082
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,488
And then your share of that
company is pretty likely to

1083
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:17,459
be about 10%.

1084
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:18,640
That certainly fluctuates.

1085
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,120
Some founders have a lot
more than this,

1086
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,170
some have a lot less.

1087
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,150
But after multiple rounds of
dilution multiple rounds of

1088
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,950
option table, option pool
creation,

1089
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,730
you're pretty likely to end
up about here.

1090
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,930
If you have more than this,

1091
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,130
I recommend Sam's post on
like the equity split

1092
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,460
between founders and
employees.

1093
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,030
You probably should be
giving out more.

1094
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,670
And then but so basically,
if you're extremely

1095
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,770
confident about building
this $100 million business,

1096
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,900
which is a big ask it should
go without saying that

1097
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
you should have a lot more
confidence than Facebook in

1098
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,330
2009 or Dropbox in 2014 and

1099
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,930
you might, for a start up
that doesn't even exist yet.

1100
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,440
Then this is worth hearing.

1101
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,460
So if you have a $100
million idea and

1102
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,750
you're pretty confident you
can execute it,

1103
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,363
I would consider that.

1104
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:05,930
If you think you're the
right entrepreneur to build

1105
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,740
Uber, Uber for space travel,
that's really huge idea.

1106
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,030
$2 billion idea.

1107
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,960
You're actually gonna have a
pretty good return for that.

1108
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
You should definitely do
that.

1109
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,370
This is also only the value
after four years.

1110
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,740
And this idea probably has
legs.

1111
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,370
So definitely go after that.

1112
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,730
If, if you're thinking of
building that,

1113
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,560
you probably shouldn't even
be in this class right now.

1114
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,010
You should go and, go and
build that company.

1115
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,042
So why is this, financial
reward and, and impact, I

1116
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,278
really think that financial
reward is very strongly

1117
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:34,220
correlated with the impact
you have on the world.

1118
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,830
If you don't believe that
let's talk

1119
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,900
through some specific
examples and

1120
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,060
not think about the equity
at all.

1121
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,010
So why might joining a, a
late-stage company actually

1122
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,980
provide you a lot of impact?

1123
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,850
You get this multiplier They
have an existing massive

1124
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,520
user base.

1125
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,190
If it's Facebook, it's a
billion users.

1126
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,380
Or if it's Google it's a
billion users.

1127
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,690
They have existing
infrastructure you

1128
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,540
get to build on.

1129
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,760
That's also increasingly
true for new startups.

1130
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,431
Things like AWS.

1131
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,170
Like awesome independent
service providers.

1132
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,598
But you usually get some,
like,

1133
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:07,080
proprietary technology and
it's all maintained for you.

1134
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,870
It's a pretty great place to
start uh, and

1135
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,640
you get to work with a team
and they'll help you

1136
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,250
just leverage your idea into
something great.

1137
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,710
So, a couple of specific
examples Bret Taylor came

1138
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,470
into employee around or

1139
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,240
came into Google as around
employee number 1,500.

1140
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,600
And he invented Google Maps.

1141
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,610
This is a product you guys
probably use every day.

1142
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,550
I used it to get here.

1143
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,170
And it's used by hundreds of
millions of

1144
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,460
people all around the world.

1145
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,320
Didn't need to start a
company to do that,

1146
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,400
did happen to get a big
financial reward.

1147
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,131
But the, the point is he had
massive impact.

1148
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:39,155
My co-founder Justin
Rosenstein.

1149
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:42,300
Joined go, Google a little
later after Brad he was

1150
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,520
a PM there.

1151
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,990
And just as a side project
he

1152
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,900
ended up prototyping a chat
which, which used to be

1153
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,340
a standalone app as
integrated into Gmail,

1154
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,210
like you see it on the upper
right there.

1155
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,105
And before he did that, like
people didn't even think you

1156
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,821
could do chat over AJAX, or
chat in the browser at all,

1157
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,065
and he just kind of like
demonstrated it, and

1158
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,220
showed it to his team, and
made it happen.

1159
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,260
Again, this is probably a
product most of

1160
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,310
you use maybe every day.

1161
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,350
And then, perhaps even more
impressively,

1162
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,510
shortly after that,.

1163
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,090
JR left,

1164
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,300
he became employee around
number 250 at Facebook.

1165
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,070
And he led a hack-a-thon
project along with

1166
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,370
people like Andrew Bosworth
and

1167
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,230
Leah Pearlman uh, to create
the like button.

1168
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,350
So, this is one of the most
popular elements anywhere

1169
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,000
on the web.

1170
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,240
Totally changes how people
use it.

1171
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,900
And again didn't need to
start a company to do it and

1172
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,060
almost certainly would have
failed if he had tried.

1173
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,440
Because he really needed the
distribution of

1174
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,310
Facebook to make it work.

1175
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,920
So important to, to keep in
mind the context for uh,

1176
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,440
what kind of company you're
trying to start and like,

1177
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,870
where will you actually be
able to make it happen.

1178
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,710
So what's the best reason?

1179
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,100
So, Sam already talked about
this a little bit but

1180
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,180
basically, you can't not do
it.

1181
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,170
You're super passionate
about this idea.

1182
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,020
You're the right person to
do it.

1183
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,320
You've gotta make it happen.

1184
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,513
So how does this break down?

1185
00:41:01,255 --> 00:41:03,660
>> Cuz we're getting close
to end here.

1186
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,520
How am I doing on time?

1187
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,130
>> Cool.

1188
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,700
Sweet.
Perfect.

1189
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,870
So this, this is sort of
like a word play.

1190
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,690
You can't not do it in two
ways.

1191
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,330
One is, you're so

1192
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,560
passionate about it that
you're just like,

1193
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,110
you have to do it.

1194
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,920
You're gonna do it anyway.

1195
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,940
And this is really
important.

1196
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,270
Cuz you'll need that passion
to get through all of

1197
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,320
those like hard parts of

1198
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,660
being an entrepreneur that
we talked about earlier.

1199
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,470
You'll also need it to
effectively recruit.

1200
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,710
Candidates can smell when
you don't have passion.

1201
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,350
And there are enough
entrepreneurs out there who

1202
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,130
do have passion.

1203
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,250
That they may as well work
for one of those.

1204
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,760
So this is sort of like
table stakes for

1205
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,460
being an entrepreneur.

1206
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,980
Your subconscious can also
tell when you

1207
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,940
don't have passion and
that'll be a huge problem.

1208
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,900
And then so the other way to
interpret this is the world

1209
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,330
needs you to do it.

1210
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,890
So this is sort of

1211
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,000
validation that the idea is
important.

1212
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,260
It's gonna make the world
better, so

1213
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,870
the world needs it.

1214
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,230
If it's not em, if it's not
something the world needs,

1215
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,936
go do something the world
needs.

1216
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:53,680
Your time's really valuable.
Um,

1217
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,240
there are plenty good ideas
out there.

1218
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,230
Maybe it's not one of your
own.

1219
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,440
Maybe it's an existing
company.

1220
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,490
But you may as well work on

1221
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,020
something that's gonna be
good.

1222
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,950
And then the second way to

1223
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,100
interpret this is the world
needs you to do it.

1224
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,420
You're actually well suited
to this problem in some way.

1225
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,080
If this isn't true it may be
a sign that

1226
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,320
your time is better spent
somewhere else.

1227
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
But also just best case
scenario if this isn't true,

1228
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,320
you out compete the team for
which it is true.

1229
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,830
And you just end

1230
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,660
up with like a sub-optimal
outcome for the world.

1231
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,410
That doesn't feel very good.

1232
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,260
So drawing this back to my
own experience at Asana,

1233
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,360
you know, Justin and

1234
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,190
I were kind of like
reluctant entrepreneurs.

1235
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,420
We, before we founded Asana
so

1236
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,250
we're working at Facebook.

1237
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,760
We were already working on a
great problem.

1238
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,470
And we would basically work
all day

1239
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,370
long on our normal projects
and

1240
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,230
then at night we would keep
working on this internal

1241
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,600
task manager that was used
internally at the company.

1242
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,630
And it was just cuz we were
like so

1243
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,080
passionate about the idea
that was so

1244
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,390
clearly valuable, that we
couldn't do anything else.

1245
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,450
And at some point we had to
have the hard

1246
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,760
conversation of like, okay
well what does it

1247
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,120
mean if we don't actually
start this company.

1248
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,020
We were pretty, we were able
to

1249
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,700
see the impact it was having
on Facebook.

1250
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,750
We were pretty convinced it

1251
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,080
could be really valuable for
the world.

1252
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,120
We were also pretty

1253
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,890
convinced nobody else was
gonna build it.

1254
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,670
The problem had been around
a long time and

1255
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,100
we just kept seeing sort of
incremental solutions to it.

1256
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,530
So if we didn't go out with
the one that we

1257
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,500
thought was best,

1258
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,140
we thought there'd be a lot
of value left on the table.

1259
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,650
And yeah.

1260
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,970
So we just couldn't,
couldn't stop working on it.

1261
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,010
And literally the idea was
like beating itself out of

1262
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,580
our chest, like forcing
itself into the world.

1263
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,080
And I think that's the
feeling you should really be

1264
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,940
looking for when you start a
company.

1265
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,360
That's how you know you have
the right idea.

1266
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,230
So I'll go ahead and stop
there.

1267
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,650
I'll put some recommended
books up here,

1268
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,562
but won't narrate them.

1269
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:34,860
And maybe, that's the end of
the class.

1270
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,397
>> Yeah, thank you.

1271
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:41,617
Maybe you guys could stick
around for

1272
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:47,560
a few minutes if you have
questions for him.

1273
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,470
And uh, see you Thursday.

1274
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,660
Thank you.
