00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,190

If investors aren't asking
about giving you money,

794
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,760
are you talking to people
about your startup?

795
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,300
Or are you running super
stealth.

796
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,890
If you're talking to people
about your startup and

797
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,350
you're getting the word out,

798
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,430
either that's through the
press or

799
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,850
just through talking to your
friends or

800
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,400
people you know doing
startups,

801
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,490
that's a good way to kind of
start feeding that.

802
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,700
The second thing is have you
created a plan so

803
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,970
that you can launch and

804
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,695
grow without needing to raise
a bunch of money.

805
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:57,810
95% of the startups that I
meet can get a product to

806
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,630
market with a very, very
little bit of money.

807
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,210
So never put

808
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,450
the investor in the ultimate
position of power.

809
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,290
We can't do anything until you
give us money.

810
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,660
You always want to flip it
around.

811
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,210
You always want it to be, this
things moving,

812
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,200
we all left our jobs, we're
all working full time.

813
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,500
And it's moving, if you want
to jump on great, if not.

814
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,410
There are a lot of angel
investors.

815
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,860
That's the attitude you
want to have.

816
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,870
That's the confidence you
want to have.

817
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,280
If you need money early,
always plan for

818
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,540
needing less money.

819
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,400
And always be able to show
that

820
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,650
you've got a fully committed
team that's working fast.

821
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,723
That's going to be

822
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:36,313
how you gain an advantage when
you can't show traction.

823
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,048
If you can show that investor
that you haven't launched yet,

824
00:31:39,048 --> 00:31:41,414
but you've done eight months
of work in one month, or

825
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:42,003
two months.

826
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:44,739
That you've got a great team
that have all quit their jobs

827
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:46,399
and they're totally committed.

828
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,553
You get some of that advantage
back.

829
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:49,514
But you don't get all of

830
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:51,750
the advantage unless you're
launched and growing.

831
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,630
So something to keep in mind.

832
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,020
Finally, how to set up
investor meetings.

833
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,830
This is really, really simple,
but I'm surprised at

834
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,160
how many companies don't get
this right.

835
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,080
The first is you want a warm
introduction from another

836
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,920
entrepreneur, preferably, or a
previous investor of yours.

837
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,420
That's where you want to
start.

838
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,740
If someone who has passed on
your company as

839
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,910
an investor offers you, to
make introductions,

840
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,770
that's kryptonite.

841
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,290
Don't touch that.

842
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,850
So first, warm introduction.

843
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,490
Very simple, you don't want to
cold call these people,

844
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,880
you don't want to bum rush
these people, the person,

845
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,760
the credibility of the person
who's introducing you to

846
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,420
an investor is a big part on

847
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,700
whether the investor will take
that meeting.

848
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,660
Second, think in parallel.

849
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,290
So many people that I meet
will run the fundraising this

850
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,650
super slow process, we met
with one guy this week,

851
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,710
we're going to schedule a
meeting with

852
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,030
another guy next week, another
guy three weeks from now.

853
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,500
When you're fundraising you're
on.

854
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,700
It's a sprint, it's not a
marathon.

855
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,179
So you want to schedule all of

856
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,890
your meetings during the same
week.

857
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,830
It's extremely hard to do, but
here's one trick that I love.

858
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,330
Tell when you're emailing
investors,

859
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,340
you're getting those warm
intros,

860
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,450
the investors email you back.

861
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,240
You say, hey, we'd love to set
up a meeting but

862
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,060
we're building like crazy for
the next two weeks.

863
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,600
So can we set it up in that
third week?

864
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,640
Right?

865
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,060
So then, you've, I've e-mailed
every one that, right?

866
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,510
So every one schedules that
meeting three weeks out.

867
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,660
It's better for them because
their calendar's open.

868
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,090
It's better for you because
you've got all

869
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,750
your meetings in one week.

870
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,000
And also, what did you do?

871
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,560
You hinted, hey, I'm not
desperate for the money.

872
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,900
We're building.

873
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,350
Like, I could meet you in
three weeks.

874
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,190
But we're building.

875
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,160
We're busy.

876
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,540
Like, it's signalling all of
the right things.

877
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,930
So that's the best way to
kind of go about how

878
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,630
you're going to do that.

879
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,210
The last thing is one team
member should be invested in

880
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,180
fundraising full time.

881
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,330
It shouldn't be something that
takes over the whole company,

882
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,520
because it's very, very
distracting.

883
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,130
So with that, let's kick it
off to the next part of this.

884
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,100
Who am I handing it to?

885
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,136
Big Dalton.

886
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,940
Yeah, that might.

887
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,315
Oh, beautiful.
All right.

888
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:59,920
Hi my name is Dalton Caldwell
I'm one of the.

889
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,100
Camera can get us here, okay.

890
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,110
Yeah, I'm one of the partners
at YC and one of the things

891
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,980
that we're going to do today
real quick is a mock pitch.

892
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,040
And first of all I know this
is a bit contrived but

893
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,580
this is in this format of like
a college class,

894
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,640
we're going to do our best to,
to have fun and

895
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,790
kind of demonstrate what it's
like.

896
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,820
And I realize there's a
million reasons why this,

897
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,770
why you could say, oh this
isn't realistic of what pitch

898
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,400
is really like but you know,
again, there's, there's a lot.

899
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah.
That we can show you.

900
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,060
Just in terms of my background
over my career,

901
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,950
I've raised 85 million over
several companies, so

902
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,670
I've sat in a lot of investor
meetings.

903
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,400
And so, I'm going to be

904
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,580
pulling as many things as I
can.

905
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,480
So again, we're just going to
try to show you

906
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,810
something to talk to, and use
it as a learning session.

907
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,980
And you already did your intro
earlier Caspar, right?

908
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,540
It's yeah I've, I mean, I've
done a couple startups.

909
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,129
Cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:49,946
So we're going to do two
pitches, and

911
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:50,936
we're going to go through them
pretty fast.

912
00:34:50,936 --> 00:34:53,843
And as, as Michael said, these
tend to go fast.

913
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,259
So let's go dive into the
first one.

914
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,440
Okay, so so Caspar, I
understand you, you're coming

915
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
to pitch me to, can, what can
you tell me about what you do?

916
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,840
So we're building a
communication platform that

917
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:12,550
will allow you know,
businesses and consumers

918
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,800
to collaborate on one single
platform rather than

919
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,770
the kind of fractured state
that they're in right now.

920
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,810
and.
I don't know,

921
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,580
I, I don't follow.

922
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,090
So, like think about like what
like WhatsApp or

923
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,320
Snapchat that's for consumers.

924
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,670
We want to do that for
businesses.

925
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,270
and, and so, what the.

926
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,670
I have to do this with a
straight face.

927
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:40,580
What, what that what that
means is we want to

928
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,280
enable consumers to talk to
businesses.

929
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,430
And that's really, what really
the goal of our business,

930
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,490
of our startup business.

931
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,850
I still don't, so, who uses
this,

932
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,780
what does this product do?

933
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,410
so, I mean, it, it.

934
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,250
It's for consumers and

935
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,450
businesses, a messaging
product.

936
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,840
a, it allows consumers to
send.

937
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,660
Why, why would,

938
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,753
why would a consumer want to
use your product?

939
00:35:59,753 --> 00:36:03,960
Because they want to message a
business.

940
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,260
okay.
well, okay,

941
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,335
what can you tell me about
the,

942
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:08,670
the market or what the opport,
what's the size of this.

943
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,570
How is this coming together?

944
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,300
Well, I mean.

945
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,370
Messaging companies are very
big.

946
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,180
Obviously Whats App sold for
like $19 billion and Snap Chat

947
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,700
is like really growing very
quickly as well so we,

948
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:25,310
I mean we think the
opportunity is very big.

949
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,593
Okay ,.
So, okay.

950
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:34,250
Okay, could you tell me a
little about your traction,

951
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,790
your numbers.

952
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,740
Like, have you, have you given
this to people yet.

953
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,740
yeah, I mean we don't want to
kind of open the Komodo and

954
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,512
kind of go into all the
details here.

955
00:36:41,512 --> 00:36:42,980
I, kind of at a high level.

956
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,010
We're live.

957
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,390
We definitely have thousands
of users in the Bay area.

958
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,700
Hundred of business, you know,
have kind of.

959
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,610
Can you tell me who some of
those businesses are?

960
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,650
There's ones that you've been
to.

961
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,190
We don't, we don't really
want to get too much into

962
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,990
the details, because, you
know, we're still early and

963
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,300
we don't want, you know, we're
trying to stay stealth.

964
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,170
Okay, well, can you tell me
about what you've learned so

965
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,250
far, what insights you've had
from.

966
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,100
Yes.
The consumers are sending

967
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,480
messages to these businesses,
and we think that's great.

968
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,410
so, and these businesses are
responding to the messages,

969
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,850
and we think that's, you know,

970
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,410
I don't think that's obvious
that that would happen.

971
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,510
So, can you tell me about what
your business model is,

972
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,000
and how.

973
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,855
Yeah, so we,

974
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:26,060
we charge businesses like a
monthly rate.

975
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,250
We haven't precisely figured
out what that is we've,

976
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,100
we've, right now we're free
for

977
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,170
the few hundred companies
we're in right now.

978
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,740
But we're looking to probably
do a monthly something.

979
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,252
How much do you

980
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:40,614
think a business will be
willing to pay?

981
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:43,180
We think certainly 10 to
$15,000 a month.

982
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,220
Okay so, so anyway could you
tell me a little bit

983
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,590
about your team and who you
have working on this.

984
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:53,350
yeah, there's we have five
founders technically I'm

985
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,210
the only one who's full time
right now the,

986
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,950
we're raising money so we can
get, you know,

987
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,430
the rest of the team on board
yeah.

988
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,590
That's this.

989
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,910
Or can any of the founders
program, or, or.

990
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,910
yeah, yeah.

991
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,100
I mean we have, I mean one of
them is a bio PhD but

992
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,248
he's like he's really picked
up coding.

993
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,071
the, the.

994
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,980
I mean, I'm a Python
developer,

995
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,620
I did learn Python the hard
way.

996
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,440
Oh, look at the time.

997
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,820
Well, it's been really great
meeting you.

998
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,812
Please keep me in the loop,
this sounds fantastic.

999
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,000
[CROSS-TALK].

1000
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,833
I'll send you an update.

1001
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,220
Great.
That was awful.

1002
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,400
So let's just go through, so.

1003
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
That was obviously not strong.

1004
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,090
So let's just talk about some
of the mistakes.

1005
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,730
So first of all, you need to

1006
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,980
make sure the person you're
talking to knows what you do.

1007
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,600
This just seems really simple,
but it's not.

1008
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,930
Yeah, this seems simple, but
it's not.

1009
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,370
So many times, people get
flustered.

1010
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,400
They get nervous, and they
start talking really fast.

1011
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
And there's no way you're ever
going to convince anyone of

1012
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,410
anything if they don't know,

1013
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,520
even what your app actually
is.

1014
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,130
You have to know your numbers
obviously.

1015
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,100
If you're very vague or

1016
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,940
evasive, like don't even have
the meeting.

1017
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,740
If you don't feel comfortable
telling an investor what your

1018
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,580
numbers are, don't even meet
with them.

1019
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,526
It means you're not ready yet,
right?

1020
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:11,086
For market size, try to give
some plausible bottom-up

1021
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:13,646
analysis and don't just
name-drop big companies that

1022
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:16,820
aren't even really related to
what you're doing.

1023
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,440
People tend to do that a lot.

1024
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,160
Try to have insights, try to
convince me that there's

1025
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,940
something that I don't already
know about the market that I

1026
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,600
learn talking to you, rather
than just

1027
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,110
what everyone knows about what
the market is.

1028
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,370
Right, I learned nothing
during that particular pitch.

1029
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,470
also, the team's just like,
why are you working on this,

1030
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,850
why are you suited for it is a
good thing to do.

1031
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,720
And finally, like,

1032
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,090
he didn't drive the
conversation anywhere.

1033
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,600
Like, obviously that went
poorly, and

1034
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,170
he just let the conversation
just, like,

1035
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,900
flail around until I cut the
medium because we ran out of

1036
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,610
time as fast as I could.

1037
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:47,970
So anyway, that was, that was
not a good pitch.

1038
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,670
So let's, let's try that
again.

1039
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,230
Okay, all right.

1040
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,120
Let's do this.

1041
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,660
Okay.
All right Caspar,

1042
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,720
well so I understand you have
a company and can you,

1043
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,010
can you just tell me a little
about what you guys do.

1044
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,660
Yes.
So we're a messaging product.

1045
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,460
We allow, I mean that sounds
kind of vague, so

1046
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,640
what we allow you to do you to
do is essentially message

1047
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,180
a location.

1048
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,840
So when you walk into a Crate
and Barrel,

1049
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,600
you can send the Crate and
Barrel manager a message like

1050
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,310
hey there's puke in the
hallway.

1051
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,750
Or if you're in the airport,
I'm trying to find this

1052
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,560
specific gate because I'm not
at this airport,

1053
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,690
where is you know where's a
terminal for Virgin.

1054
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,060
Or if you're at Target, what
aisle.

1055
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,070
Okay, so is this a mobile app
or what how do I use it?

1056
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,690
Yeah, so on the consumer side
we have iOS Android app,
