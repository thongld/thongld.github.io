1185
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE
Hopefully, if you have a
strong culture,

1186
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,490
I didn't recommend we do any
of that.

1187
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,690
We hired engineers that we
felt like fit the values.

1188
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,880
And it just independently
occurred to

1189
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,770
them they should do that.

1190
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,130
They felt like that was the
right thing to do.

1191
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,310
>> All the way in the back.

1192
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,300
>> You talked about how
during the conventions you

1193
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,640
didn't have any money and

1194
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,090
only a couple people visited
your site.

1195
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,090
What did you do to increase
the number of

1196
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,250
users that came to your
site?

1197
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,280
How did you scale that out?

1198
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,020
>> So the question was,
Brian had talked about

1199
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,790
that there weren't that many
visitors to the site

1200
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,410
when they were trying to
sort of get off the ground.

1201
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,095
How did they get users to
the site?

1202
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:37,230
>> So this is actually not
about culture but

1203
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,050
I will answer it anyway.

1204
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,235
So, you know a lot of
people,

1205
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:45,460
this is not even a culture
question, but the best

1206
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,530
advice I ever got was
probably from Paul Graham.

1207
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,520
And Paul Graham basically
said,

1208
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,220
I remember he had this line.

1209
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,330
He said it's better, he may
have even talked about this

1210
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:58,241
at a talk, he said it's
better to have 100 people

1211
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:01,087
that love you than to have a
million people that just

1212
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,280
kinda sorta like you.

1213
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,710
It's literally better to
have 100 people love you.

1214
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,244
And the reason why, if you
have a million costumers or

1215
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:08,146
a million users and

1216
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,061
they just kinda don't care
about you but

1217
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,900
they kinda use your app and
you're okay.

1218
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,600
To get them to care is a
really, really hard thing.

1219
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,160
In fact, I don't know how to
get a million people to

1220
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,450
all of a sudden care.

1221
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,260
What I do know is if you get
100 people that love you,

1222
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,210
those people if they feel
incredibly passionate,

1223
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,950
each of them will tell 100
people.

1224
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,970
And in fact all movements
typically start, or

1225
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,850
companies or ideas that are
really powerful,

1226
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,100
start with just 100 people.

1227
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,980
So the reason this is so

1228
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,290
critical is he gave us
another lesson.

1229
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,490
Which is if all you need to
do

1230
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,140
is get 100 people to love
you.

1231
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,528
Then what you need to do is
things that don't scale.

1232
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:44,800
So it's hard if you have a
million people you

1233
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,710
can't meet all of them.

1234
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,290
But you can meet 100 people.

1235
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,880
You can spend time with
them.

1236
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,510
So that's exactly what we
did.

1237
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,630
Joanie and I,

1238
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,940
we would go door to door in
New York City or in Denver

1239
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,390
where the Democratic
National Convention was.

1240
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,260
Literally meeting with,
staying with and

1241
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,050
living with our users.

1242
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,360
I use to joke that when you
buy an iPhone Steve Jobs

1243
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,930
didn't come and sleep on
your couch but I did.

1244
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:07,600
And that, that was really
critical,

1245
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,930
living with your users.

1246
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,670
And by living with our users
and spending time with them,

1247
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,290
all we had to do is give
them enough time, attention.

1248
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:14,977
And get them to get to

1249
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:17,210
the point where they were
deeply passionate.

1250
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,560
And if you work backwards
from 100 people or

1251
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,970
even one person.

1252
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,310
Without even technology,

1253
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,720
imagine what would be an
amazing experience for

1254
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,210
just this one person.

1255
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,710
And walk through the journey
from the time they,

1256
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,150
whatever your service is,
right?

1257
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,500
And make it perfect for that
one person.

1258
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,690
Once you make a service
perfect for

1259
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,710
one person, it's actually
really easy to

1260
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,410
make almost anything perfect
for a person.

1261
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,880
It's not actually that hard.

1262
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,360
The hard thing is then how
do we scale this to

1263
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,540
millions of people.

1264
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,840
Where everyone gets in
trouble is they try to

1265
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,060
solve both at the same time.

1266
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,060
So, the first thing we

1267
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,868
do is get the perfect
experience for one person.

1268
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:49,240
We went door-to-door to do
this,

1269
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,340
we won over their love.

1270
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,460
Then we use a separate part
of our brain to imagine,

1271
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,410
now how would we achieve
that at scale?

1272
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,310
And I'll give you one
example before I

1273
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,150
stop talking about this.

1274
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,820
Right now on Airbnb you can,

1275
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,860
if you put your home on
Airbnb,

1276
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,950
you can click a button and
it kinda works like UBER.

1277
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:04,900
And we did this before UBER,

1278
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,420
a professional photographer
comes to your house and

1279
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,970
they'll photograph your
homes for free.

1280
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,830
We have 5000 photographers
around the world, and

1281
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,690
we photographed hundreds of
thousands of homes.

1282
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,620
So it's probably one of the
largest on-demand

1283
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,710
photography networks, if
there was such a thing,

1284
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,650
I guess probably the only
one in the world.

1285
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,890
And that started with Joe
and I.

1286
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,490
We were living, we were
staying not living,

1287
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,040
staying with this one host
in New York City.

1288
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,730
And her house is amazing,
but

1289
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,620
her photos were terrible.

1290
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,350
And we said, why don't you
just put up better photos?

1291
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,770
And this is before, you
know,

1292
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,370
iPhones had great cameras,
this was 2008.

1293
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,250
And she said, well,

1294
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,940
I can't figure out how to
get photos from this camera,

1295
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,190
onto this computer.

1296
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,500
She wasn't very technically
savvy.

1297
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,220
And we just said well, we'll
just take photos for you.

1298
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,060
Or actually I said, what if
you can press a button and

1299
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,460
somebody just showed up at
your door and

1300
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,810
took professional
photographs.

1301
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,829
She said, that would be
magic.

1302
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:56,871
So next day, I knocked on
her door and said I'm here.

1303
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:59,787
And I photographed her home.

1304
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:01,647
And then we sent emails to
people saying,

1305
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:03,783
we have this new magical
photography service.

1306
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:05,429
And if you want you can
press this button and

1307
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:07,594
a professional photographer
will show up at your home.

1308
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:08,902
Somewhere just press this
button and

1309
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:10,214
just send me an alert or Joe
an alert.

1310
00:45:10,214 --> 00:45:11,711
And we'd rent a camera in
Brooklyn.

1311
00:45:11,711 --> 00:45:14,030
In January of 2009 walking
through snow,

1312
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,160
photographing people's
homes.

1313
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,210
We did this by hand without
any technology.

1314
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,240
We managed it with just
spreadsheets.

1315
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,894
I wasn't gonna burden Nate
with trying to

1316
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:24,600
build something we designed
before we had photography.

1317
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,210
Then we started hiring
contract photographers.

1318
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:27,820
Then eventually we

1319
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,370
got a intern to manage all
the contract photographers.

1320
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,990
Then we got a intern to
become

1321
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,860
a full-time employee
managing other interns to

1322
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,380
manage the contract
employees.

1323
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,320
>> And at some point, this
is before we built anything.

1324
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,490
And at some point there were
too many,

1325
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,520
like people to manage.

1326
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,440
Like, there were like
hundreds of photographers.

1327
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,610
And then we finally built
all of

1328
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,600
the tools to manage all the
photography.

1329
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,928
But we did it only after we
knew exactly what

1330
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,969
the perfect service was.

1331
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:52,711
>> How about one more
question?

1332
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,298
>> One more question.

1333
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:56,513
>> So a lot of people say
that when,

1334
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:59,309
when the hardest part isn't
the technology.

1335
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:00,410
Here the marketing,

1336
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:03,340
the communication is the
hardest part there would be.

1337
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,940
And a lot of people say it's
not

1338
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,480
the technology
>> So

1339
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,760
do you wanna repeat the
question?

1340
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,420
>> So the question is a lot
of peop in this particular

1341
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,830
situation with Airbnb, a lot
of people think that this is

1342
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,610
not necessarily a technology
company, but

1343
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,940
it's more of a marketing
company.

1344
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,750
>> Good question.

1345
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,686
So I'll, well, I'll tell
you,

1346
00:46:24,686 --> 00:46:26,700
I'll answer the question
with a story.

1347
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,402
>> Okay, let me, let me, let
me, let me just,

1348
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:32,940
let me preface that question
by a set of questions.

1349
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,620
Do you have, do you today
have proprietary technology?

1350
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,440
>> Yes.

1351
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,040
>> Do you have a moat?

1352
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,660
>> Yes.

1353
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,551
>> Do you have network
effects?

1354
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:42,453
>> Yes.

1355
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:43,870
>> Do you have pricing
power?

1356
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,522
>> Yes.

1357
00:46:45,522 --> 00:46:47,070
>> Do you have a good brand?

1358
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,087
>> I think so.

1359
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:52,504
>> Are are you a monopoly?

1360
00:46:52,504 --> 00:46:54,390
>> I'm not gonna answer
that.

1361
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,620
>> But, but I think similar
to the question

1362
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,040
just forgetting about all of
that.

1363
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,840
It, companies that have
network affects and

1364
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,790
sort of get off the ground
based on.

1365
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,460
>> Yeah.
>> The fly wheel is going.

1366
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,500
>> Yep.
>> People just think that

1367
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,190
you're lucky.

1368
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,190
>> Yeah, let me, let me.

1369
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,540
It's a totally fair
question.

1370
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,310
And people have said it.

1371
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,720
So, I wanna answer it.

1372
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,543
You guy that runs the
Sequoia Capital now,

1373
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:17,960
his name is Doug Leoni.

1374
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,780
>> Yep.

1375
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,300
>> One day, I think it was a
year, year and

1376
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,200
a half ago, Doug Leoni says,
your job sucks.

1377
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,780
>> And I was like, what the
hell does that mean?

1378
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,460
Like this is like,

1379
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,700
you've got the worst job of
an CEO in my portfolio.

1380
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,720
And I said, tell me why.

1381
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,920
And this is what he said.

1382
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,310
He says, well, let me,
here's how I think about it.

1383
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,220
First of all, you're a
technology company.

1384
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,500
And he thought we were a
technology company and

1385
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,760
I would say, at our heart,

1386
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,470
in many ways we are a
technology company.

1387
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,280
And so, we have all the
challenges of all my

1388
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,720
other portfolio companies.

1389
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,750
But beyond that, you are in
190 countries.

1390
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,510
And so, you have to figure
out how to be international.

1391
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,980
We have to hire people in

1392
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,900
countries all over the
world.

1393
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,450
We're literally in every
country but

1394
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,180
North Korea, Rio, Syria, and
Cuba.

1395
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,230
You're a, basically a
payments company.

1396
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,259
We handle billions of

1397
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:01,270
dollars through our system
every year.

1398
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,880
And we had to get

1399
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,200
money transmitter licenses
in the state of California.

1400
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,230
So we actually are a
payments company, and

1401
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,110
we have serious fraud and
risk to, to, to warrant, and

1402
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,350
needs to be locked down like
Fort Knox.

1403
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,760
He said, that's, that's
usually where companies end.

1404
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,400
But you've gotta worry about
all the other crap.

1405
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,244
And he says, trust in
safety.

1406
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,671
You know we have 425,000
people staying in

1407
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:22,271
other people's, under, in
other people's beds,

1408
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,719
in their sheets.

1409
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:26,206
>> Think about a woman from
Texas staying in

1410
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,111
the Middle East or vice
versa.

1411
00:48:28,111 --> 00:48:30,448
The cultural conflicts that
could happen and

1412
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:31,802
misunderstandings and,

1413
00:48:31,802 --> 00:48:34,760
you know, you have 425,000
people a night.

1414
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,632
It's like being the mayor of
Oakland.

1415
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:38,298
Now, imagine if you're the
mayor of Oakland,

1416
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,510
all these things happen in
Oakland tonight.

1417
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,368
>> So you've got trust in
safety.

1418
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:44,290
Now, we have regulatory
problems.

1419
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,850
You know, we are in 34,000
cities.

1420
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,330
Every city has a different
law, different rules.

1421
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,720
And many of them were
written in a different

1422
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,765
century, before you had any
of this technology.

1423
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:54,790
So you've got to deal with
that.

1424
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,380
Then you've got issues like
search and discovery.

1425
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,200
So, Google's got this brand
about being really

1426
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,170
important about search.

1427
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:00,980
The thing about search,

1428
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,710
though, is usually if I have
a question, if Google can

1429
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:07,420
give me 40,000 results, but
it's probably clear that

1430
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,960
there's like one or two best
options for everybody.

1431
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,320
So if I wanna know a
question to an answer,

1432
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,570
these are usually my best
answer.

1433
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:15,990
We have 40,000 homes in
Paris.

1434
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,530
There is no best home in
Paris for

1435
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,790
anybody in this room.

1436
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,000
So we have to be really,

1437
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,320
really great at matching
people and technology.

1438
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,480
We have to be a company
that's just, you know,

1439
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,380
another example.

1440
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,640
Facebook, for example, is a
digital product.

1441
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,570
Their product is their
website.

1442
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,420
Our product are these
experiences you

1443
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,850
have in the real world.

1444
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,070
So, we're not just an online
product.

1445
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:36,300
We have to be an offline
product.

1446
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,720
And we need to transition
from when you're in

1447
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,950
your app, through cities.

1448
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,010
And these are just some of
the examples why technology,

1449
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:43,980
design.

1450
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,250
So basically, the long and

1451
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,450
short of it is we have to be
world class at technology.

1452
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,130
We have to be world class at
design.

1453
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,070
We have to be world class at
branding, because we've got

1454
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,760
to convince people this
isn't crazy.

1455
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,360
You're not gonna die when
you use it.

1456
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,450
We had to convince
governments,

1457
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:57,600
this is good for
neighborhood.

1458
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,670
What happens if the internet
moves into

1459
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:59,200
your neighborhood?

1460
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,600
That's what people call it.

1461
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,090
It's a good thing,
hopefully.

1462
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,930
And you've got to make sure
trust in safety is really

1463
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,940
world class, that we handle
all these payments and

1464
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,630
not have problems with risk.

1465
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,850
And I can kind of go
through, and

1466
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:10,410
this is not even to do with
culture.

1467
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,130
I didn't even mention
culture.

1468
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,590
So, that's how I describe it
is like,

1469
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,550
I think great companies are
companies that are probably

1470
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,950
really strong at everything.

1471
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,211
But you know, we have,

1472
00:50:18,211 --> 00:50:19,999
we try to hire the very best
engineers and

1473
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:21,473
technical talent in the
world and

1474
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:23,754
I definitely don't see us as
a marketing company.

1475
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,509
>> Thank you.

1476
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:25,318
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, guys.

1477
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,753
>> All right, thank you sir.
