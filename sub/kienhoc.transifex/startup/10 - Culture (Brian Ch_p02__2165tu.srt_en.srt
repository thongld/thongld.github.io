297
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE
understand the culture was
important.

298
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,030
>> So Airbnb and then
building the company.

299
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,120
Yeah, so I think one of the
things we realize is so

300
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,290
just to give you.

301
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,350
I won't tell the full story
of

302
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,810
everyone being some you may
know it, but.

303
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,190
The very short version of
this story was that,

304
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,460
Airbnb wasn't meant to be,
like,

305
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,010
the company we were trying
to start.

306
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,070
I had quit my job,

307
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,360
I was complete, I was living
in LA.

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,396
One day I drove to San
Francisco,

309
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:20,743
became roommates with my,
friend from college,

310
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:24,700
I went to Joe Gebia, and I
had $1,000 in the bank.

311
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,934
And the rent was $1,150.

312
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,864
So that weekend this
international design

313
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,850
conference was coming to San
Francisco.

314
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,020
All the hotels were sold
out.

315
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,630
We had this idea,

316
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,610
let's just turn our house
into a bed and

317
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,850
breakfast for the
conference.

318
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,055
I didn't have any beds.

319
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,060
Joe had three air beds.

320
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,080
We pulled them out of the
closets.

321
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,410
We called it the air bed and
breakfast.

322
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,490
That's how the company
started.

323
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,910
I probably told that story
10,000 times, by the way.

324
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,750
Some version of that story.

325
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,810
And I didn't think I'd ever
tell that a second time.

326
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:54,870
when, I, I remember growing
up, I, I also went to

327
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,830
college, and my parents were
social workers, and they had

328
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,370
kinda been nervous about me
going to art school.

329
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,080
They kinda worried that
maybe I would like not

330
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,490
get a job after college,
which is I'm sure a lot of

331
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,430
parents are worried about,
so she said, make sure you

332
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,180
promise you get a job with
health insurance.

333
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,045
I ended up starting Air Bed
and

334
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:11,680
Breakfast.com was the
original name.

335
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
She remembered her telling
me I

336
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,252
guess you never got that job
with health insurance.

337
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:18,070
The reason I say this though
is this.

338
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,530
Airbnb was never meant to be
the big idea.

339
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,160
It was meant to be the thing
to pay the rent so

340
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,230
we could think of the big
idea.

341
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,850
And along the way by solving
our own problem,.

342
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,050
It became the big idea.

343
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,860
So alongside that and, and
I'm not gonna

344
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,480
talk about like kind of how
he built the product.

345
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,620
That's probably another
conversation that some other

346
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,920
people were talking about.

347
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,470
You have to build a team in
a great company.

348
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,220
And in the early days, we
had three co-founders, Joe,

349
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,350
Nate and myself.

350
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,330
And I kind of think of one
of

351
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,970
the reasons we're successful
was I was really lucky.

352
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,560
And I don't think I was
really lucky because we

353
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,670
came up with the idea of
Airbnb.

354
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,010
I don't think we're really
lucky that we

355
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,310
became successful once we
had the team.

356
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,430
I think we could have come
up with a lot of ideas, and

357
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,230
been somewhat successful.

358
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,350
I think I was lucky cuz I
found two great people that

359
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,470
I wanted to start a company
with.

360
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,380
People I admired,

361
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,260
that almost intimidated me
how talented,

362
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,460
how smart they were.

363
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,990
And I think that's one of
the first things you got

364
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,080
to build a team that is so
talented that they kind of

365
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,850
almost make you slightly
uncomfortable because they

366
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,530
know by being with them
you're going to have to

367
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,540
raise your game to be with
them.

368
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,280
And then when we were
working together in

369
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,260
the early days.

370
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,170
This is like 2008.

371
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,620
The first thing is we, we
were like a family.

372
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,720
You think about founders.

373
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,080
Founders are like parents
and the company is a child.

374
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,950
And a child will manifest in
many ways behaviors that

375
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,370
parents have between their
relationship.

376
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,920
If the parents are
dysfunctional.

377
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,110
They're not working
together.

378
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,180
Then the child's gonna be
frankly pretty fucked up.

379
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,310
And so you don't want that.

380
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,560
You want your culture to be
awesome.

381
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,790
And so Joanie and

382
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,210
I, we're like total, total
family in the beginning.

383
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,560
We worked 18 hours a day, 7
days a week.

384
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,840
I remember when we're white
commentator.

385
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,090
We like, worked together.

386
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,500
We like, ate food together.

387
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,040
We like, even went to the
gym together.

388
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,280
We may as well have gotten
jump suits.

389
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,260
We didn't go that far.

390
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,897
But we were like.

391
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:52,895
It was like we were on a
mission.

392
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,263
I felt like we were like
special forces or something.

393
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:58,397
And we had this like amazing
shared way of doing things.

394
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,030
Amazing accountability.

395
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,448
And then we realized that
was like the DNA of

396
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:04,478
the company.

397
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:07,041
And then, we started
thinking at some point you

398
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,360
go from building the product
to phase two.

399
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,900
Which is building the
company that

400
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,360
builds the product.

401
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
And so a lot of the talk is
about how do

402
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,350
you build a product, how do
you get product market fit.

403
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,040
Once people start doing that
now you've got to

404
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,000
build a company.

405
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,060
And it doesn't matter how
great your

406
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,700
original product or idea is
if you can't build

407
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,380
a great company then your
product will not endure.

408
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,010
As we thought about this and
one of the things he

409
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,650
realized is we want to build
a company for the long term.

410
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,970
The last thing is that I
want to build something,

411
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,740
I mean, think about it this
way.

412
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,770
If, if your company like
your child,

413
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,530
a parent wants his child to
outlive him or her.

414
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,420
It would be a tragedy to
outlive your child.

415
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,490
Also, I felt it would be a
tragedy for

416
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,700
us to outlive our company
and

417
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,670
just watch it rise and fall.

418
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,290
We didn't want that.

419
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,290
We wanted a company that
would endure.

420
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,730
And so to do that, we
started

421
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,270
noticing companies have
something in common.

422
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,550
Companies that were around
for

423
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,980
a really long time had a
clear mission.

424
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,490
And they had a clear sense
of values.

425
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,590
They had a shared way of
doing something that was

426
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,980
unique to them and was
really, really special.

427
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,000
And so, then, Joanie and I,
when we were three people,

428
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,040
decided to look around
companies.

429
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,110
I noticed Apple, you know,

430
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,360
Steve Jobs talked about his
core value as that he

431
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,480
believed people with passion
could change the world.

432
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,020
And he said our products
change but

433
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,670
our value never had.

434
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,000
And we learned about Amazon.

435
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,930
We learned about Nike.

436
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,410
We learned about companies
in early days.

437
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,350
You can even use this to
talk about organizations you

438
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,250
know even like a founding of
a,

439
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,980
a nation has a strong values
and a declaration.

440
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,470
Then the country might
endure longer.

441
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,010
As we started realizing like
we need to have intention.

442
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,590
Culture needs to be
designed.

443
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,650
And that's kinda how we got
connected is because

444
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,400
you know, when we were
funded by Sequoia.

445
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,420
Alfred Lin had just joined
from Zappos Sequoia.

446
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,450
And I was told Zappos had an
amazing culture and

447
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,330
we went to Las Vegas and met
up with Tony and

448
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:44,870
we learned about it.

449
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,410
>> And so what did you
learn.

450
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:47,910
>> Well.

451
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,630
>> You guys were crazy.

452
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,330
I, the, the thing we
learned.

453
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,190
And we were three people
with you need to have,

454
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,730
like, if culture's a shared
way of doing things,

455
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,700
there's really two parts.

456
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,860
One is behaviors and those
can kinda change, and

457
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,580
maybe 50 years from now
there will be rituals and

458
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,540
behaviors that will change,
be different.

459
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,470
But there has to be some
things that never change.

460
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,480
Some principles,

461
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,610
some ideas that endure, that
make you, you.

462
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,010
And I think of core values
as integrity, honesty,

463
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,940
those aren't core values,

464
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,230
cuz they're values everyone
should have.

465
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,940
They're, like, integrity
values.

466
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,689
But would there have to be
like three, five,

467
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,010
six things that are unique
to you and

468
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,130
you can probably think about
this in your life.

469
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,510
What is different about you
than

470
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,770
every single other person.

471
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,576
If you could only tell
somebody three or

472
00:17:28,576 --> 00:17:31,080
four things, what do you
want them to know about you?

473
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,810
And we realized that when
Zappos has 100 employees,

474
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,870
they wrote down these nine
core, is it nine?

475
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,180
>> Ten, ten.
>> Ten, ten core values.

476
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,850
And the only thing I learned
from Tony is you said I

477
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,620
wish I didn't wait until I
was a 100 employees-

478
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,190
>> Yeah.

479
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,370
>> To write down our core
values.

480
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,090
So I think I was talking to
Sam he

481
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,460
says he thinks we're one of
the only companies that

482
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,780
wrote our core values down
before we hired anyone.

483
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,120
>> How long did it take you
to hire a first employee?

484
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,370
>> So our first employee was
our first engineer.

485
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,780
And I think we looked for
him for four or five months.

486
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,050
And I probably interviewed,

487
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,550
I probably looked through
thousands of people and

488
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,180
interviewed hundreds of
people.

489
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,870
>> And by then, when you
hired the pro,

490
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,590
when did you write it?

491
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,520
Did you write it?
Did you write it

492
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,330
on day one or did you, was
it month three?

493
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,115
>> I think we started
working on it

494
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:14,245
around the time of like
culminator,

495
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,661
which would have been
January 2009.

496
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,903
And it was probably a
process that evolved over

497
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:20,980
the course of six to seven
months.

498
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,307
We finished Y Combinator in
April 2009.

499
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:25,770
I think we hired our first
engineer in July.

500
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,370
Something like that.

501
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,010
So it's probably like six
months.

502
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,480
And the rea.
Cuz some people ask, like,

503
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,470
why did you spend so

504
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,320
much time on, like, hiring
your first engineer?

505
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,080
And here's how we thought
about it.

506
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
I kinda felt like your first
engineer was

507
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,520
like bringing in DNA to your
company.

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,690
This person was gonna, like,
there were gonna be a.

509
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,950
If we were successful,

510
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,560
there were gonna be 1,000
people just like him or

511
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,330
her in the company.

512
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,060
And so, it wasn't a matter
of like,

513
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,090
getting somebody to build
the next three features that

514
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,690
we needed to ship for our
users.

515
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,440
There was something much
more long-term and

516
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,620
much more enduring.

517
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,810
Which was, do I wanna work
with a 100 or

518
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,230
a 1,000 more people like
this?

519
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,270
Now you want diversity but

520
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,340
you don't want, you want
diversity of like beliefs,

521
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,830
you want diversity of like
backgrounds, age,.

522
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,200
You don't want diversity of
values.

523
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
You want a very, very
homogenous beliefs and

524
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,900
that's the one thing that
shouldn't be diverse.

525
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,440
>> So what, what are
Airbnb's values?

526
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,300
>> We have six core values.

527
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,240
I'll maybe talk about three
of them.

528
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,900
>> Okay.

529
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,070
>> So our first core value
that

530
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,190
we talk about is champion
the mission.

531
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,260
And what it really means is
that we want to

532
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,290
hire people that are here
for a mission.

533
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,100
We don't want people here
because they think we've got

534
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,810
a great valuation, they like
our office design.

535
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,440
They need a job or they
think it's hot.

536
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,130
We want people to be here
for

537
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,920
the one thing that will
never change, and

538
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,280
that's our mission.

539
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,090
And just to tell you a quick
story about our mission.

540
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,870
You know, Airbnb, you know,

541
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,980
a lot of people describe it
as a way to book a room or

542
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,730
book a house when you travel
around the world.

543
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,750
And that's what we do.

544
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,880
But that's not at all why we
do it.

545
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,680
And to answer the question
of, like, what,

546
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
what our mission is, I'll
just tell you a quick story.

547
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,090
And this, I think, describes
it.

548
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,060
In early 2012, I met a host
named Sebastian.

549
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,780
So we do these meet-ups
around the world where you

550
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,830
meet with hosts.

551
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,210
And I meet this host named
Sebastian.

552
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,660
He's probably, like, late
50s.

553
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,450
He lives in north London.

554
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,140
And Sebastian looks at me.

555
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,970
He says, Brian.

556
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,910
There's this word you never
use in your website.

557
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,520
And I said, what's that
word?

558
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,320
He said that word is
friendship.

559
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,840
I would love to tell you the
story about friendship.

560
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,980
I said, okay.

561
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,990
Tell me the story about
friendship.

562
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,140
He said six months ago,

563
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,770
the run riots broke out in
front of my home and

564
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,340
I was very scared.

565
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,810
And the next day my mom
called my to

566
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,770
make sure I was okay.

567
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,670
He said yeah, mom.

568
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm okay.

569
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,840
He said, what about the
house?

570
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,400
And he says well yeah, the
house is okay as well.

571
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,630
He said, here's the
interesting thing.

572
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,710
Between the time the riots
broke out.

573
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,130
And the time my mom called
me,

574
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,480
was a 24 hour window of
time.

575
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,830
And in that period of time
he said,

576
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,990
seven of my previous Airbnb
guests called me.

577
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,130
Just to make sure I was
okay.

578
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,250
He said, think about that.

579
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,430
Seven of my guests called me
before my own mother did.

580
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,540
I don't know what that says
about our guests or

581
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,260
his mother more but-

582
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,150
>> But in this summer.

583
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,870
On a typical night or

584
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,399
a peak night we would have
425,000 people,

585
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:07,520
25,000 people staying in
homes and living together.

586
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,390
And they were coming from
195 countries in the world.

587
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,210
Which is every country but

588
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,220
North Korea, Iran, Syria and
Cuba.

589
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,900
So when you hear that story,

590
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,270
at our core what we're
about,

591
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,650
that's much more than just
booking a room or traveling.

592
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,880
What we are about is we
