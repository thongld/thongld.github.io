997
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,990
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQOC-qy-GDY
just have an email exchange,
right?

998
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,820
Because it's very easy for

999
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,860
them to like forget about
it, ignore it.

1000
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,300
So you wanna like, actually
try to get in contact with

1001
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,830
them, set up a meeting.

1002
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,230
Okay.
So, then

1003
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,430
the next step is actually
pitch them.

1004
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,970
What I usually do is
actually write out all

1005
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,940
my new, like the story that
I would want to see

1006
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,300
published like in bullet
points.

1007
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,020
And I like, will write out
the story,

1008
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,130
like my ideal story and I
will memorize it.

1009
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:19,160
Like the entire like set of
bullet points and when I

1010
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,670
have a conversation with
them, if it's in person,

1011
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,530
I'll like walk them through
this, like I'll have

1012
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,560
a conversation that's like
structured like my outline.

1013
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,750
And they'll be like taking
notes, right?

1014
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,440
And then they'll go and

1015
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,210
transcribe those notes into
a story.

1016
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,970
And so it's like a tell it,
like what I wrote will

1017
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,180
eventually be translated
into a actual story.

1018
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,810
And, you know, by preparing
you can actually you know,

1019
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,660
much more easily control the
conversation and

1020
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,890
not forget critical things
like, you know,

1021
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,720
your co-founder, mentioning
your co-founder's name.

1022
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,760
Or like,

1023
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,570
what all the features in
your awesome app are.

1024
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,880
If it's, I'm doing this on
the phone, I will like,

1025
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,490
have this bullet points in
front of me and

1026
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,300
I will make sure to like
walk through

1027
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,499
a conversation that includes
all of those things.

1028
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,090
So, you know, you do that,
they,

1029
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,960
you have a pitch, they, they
take notes.

1030
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,380
They're gonna write the
story of this time.

1031
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,320
And then, the next thing is
like, follow up,

1032
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,580
like a couple days, or day
before your actual news goes

1033
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,870
out, you want to send them
an email that says, like.

1034
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,000
You know, this is the time
we're launching the app.

1035
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,655
Like, thanks for meeting,
here's like collateral like

1036
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:23,950
maybe if you have like a
video or photos or

1037
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,770
something you want them to
include screen shots.

1038
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,330
Like how to spell your
co-founders' names and

1039
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,235
your name.

1040
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:30,910
Just like include all the
information that I

1041
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,570
really care about and I bold
it right?

1042
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,210
And then that's it.

1043
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,570
Then hopefully the day comes
you press submit on

1044
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,754
the release to the app store
and

1045
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:44,946
at the same time they
release their article on

1046
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:47,219
TechCrunch and you are
famous.

1047
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:54,930
Okay, so a lot of people ask
us about PR firms.

1048
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,795
so.

1049
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:57,473
You know, I think in the
beginning.

1050
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:59,741
It's kind of like everything
else you do at a start,

1051
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:00,354
you want to do it

1052
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:02,790
yourself before you hire
someone else to do it.

1053
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,720
And it's actually pretty
easy,

1054
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,800
especially with tech press
who,

1055
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,230
you know, and bloggers who,

1056
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,780
like, constantly need new
things to write about.

1057
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,850
You know.

1058
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,240
I strongly encourage people
to, like,

1059
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,470
try it themselves and kind
of get started by learning

1060
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,590
the process themselves
before they hire anyone.

1061
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,050
One thing I'll say is that
like firms can,

1062
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,800
can only help you with like
kind of the contacts and

1063
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,560
the logistics, but it can't
help you

1064
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,010
know what's interesting
about your company or very,

1065
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,990
you know, I've never had
anyone whose been able to

1066
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,740
tell me what the stories
that I'm producing are.

1067
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,730
They've only been able to
tell me,

1068
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,130
you know, like you're you
know, like here's a the,

1069
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,000
here's a list of reporters
that you might wanna contact

1070
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,260
So, you know, you really
have to be responsible for

1071
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,190
thinking about like,

1072
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,370
what's interesting about
your company and

1073
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,130
what are you doing, you
know, what's the road map of

1074
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,000
interesting things that
you're working on.

1075
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,330
They're also really
expensive.

1076
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,437
You know, I think we were
spending between $5,000 and

1077
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:54,760
$20,000 a month which is
like a very, for

1078
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,710
various firms that's a lot
for a start up, right?

1079
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,900
You should, it's generally.

1080
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,100
Not a good use of money, I
would say.

1081
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,350
Especially in the very early
days.

1082
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:08,410
You know, getting press is,
is a lot of work.

1083
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,620
So you should really make
sure it's worth it.

1084
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,810
You know, like I said it
really,

1085
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,650
getting press doesn't mean,
it feels like,

1086
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,740
it's like a vanity metric.

1087
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,970
Right?
It feels like you're being

1088
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,020
successful because lots of
succesful companies.

1089
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,720
You know, like Google and

1090
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,660
Facebook, are covered in the
press all the time.

1091
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,100
But it doesn't actually mean
you're successful.

1092
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,140
It doesn't, you know,
actually give you, you know,

1093
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,670
mean that you're getting,
you're making money,

1094
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,550
you're getting users, you're
making those users happy.

1095
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:31,780
it's, you know,

1096
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,500
sometimes it's a really good
strategy for

1097
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,480
getting your first 100, or
200, or 1,000 customers.

1098
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,690
But it's really not a
scalable user acquisition

1099
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,800
strategy, so it's something
that's really just like a,

1100
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,280
you know, a boot strap.

1101
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:43,850
You can't, like,

1102
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:47,268
just get, like, infinity
articles written about you.

1103
00:46:47,268 --> 00:46:48,440
Like, eventually people are
going to,

1104
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,470
like, get tired of hearing
about your company, and

1105
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,570
usually that happens pretty,
pretty quickly, right.

1106
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,120
The whole point about news
is that it's new, and so

1107
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,150
it's, it's pretty, pretty,
pretty hard, unless your

1108
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,160
Google, to get covered in
the press like every week,

1109
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,800
you know, with something.

1110
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,410
to, you know, if you decide
it's worth it though,

1111
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,970
like you do wanna have like
a regular heartbeat of news.

1112
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,510
So that's like something
where, you know,

1113
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,430
you're planning out those
types of the, what,

1114
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,970
your thing about what your
doing, that matches those,

1115
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,150
you know, maybe seven story
types in the future like,

1116
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,890
you know, when I was You
know, working primarily on

1117
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,760
marketing and, and PR, it
would be, I would like,

1118
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,070
make a schedule on like a
calendar.

1119
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,180
Have what, when we're gonna
launch things and like,

1120
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,480
make sure to space them out,
but like have them,

1121
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,240
you know, appear regular, at
regular intervals so

1122
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,890
that people like didn't want
to forget about us.

1123
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,240
And we could kind of
maximize our coverage.

1124
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,820
And, you might really want
keep your, you know,

1125
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,530
contacts fresh.

1126
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,990
It like, really a
relationships business.

1127
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,140
So once you, someone writes
about you,

1128
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,410
you should keep going back
to them for, for

1129
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,180
more, for writing about,

1130
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,680
you know, to write about you
in the future.

1131
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,680
It's kind of like, you know,
when, when basically people,

1132
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,780
you know, you're more likely
to do something for

1133
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,480
someone you've, like,
already done something for.

1134
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,880
Yeah, you really, like,
it's, if you just, you know,

1135
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,360
I would try to establish
good,

1136
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,170
good relationships with a
couple reporters over time

1137
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:06,000
that you can go to to, you
know, break news.

1138
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,780
And it, it will come in

1139
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,800
handy later if you ever
have, are in the position,

1140
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,210
if you're fortunate enough
to be in the position where

1141
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,720
people are writing negative
things about you, you know,

1142
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,680
having relationships will
help you, you know, kind of

1143
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,460
get your side of the story
out, The last thing is like,

1144
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,580
you know, it's kind of
Golden Rule really, or

1145
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,750
maybe more like a pay it
forward really applies here.

1146
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,180
Like, you should really help
your

1147
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,610
fellow entrepreneurs get,

1148
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,200
get coverage because they
will help you get coverage.

1149
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,130
The best way to get covered
is really through these like

1150
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,120
warm introductions.

1151
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,730
And so you know, whenever
I'm meeting with reporters,

1152
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,530
I always help like.

1153
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,320
Throwing out the names of
like other things that I

1154
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
think would be interesting
stories for them.

1155
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,520
And usually that comes back.

1156
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,450
They, the, the reporters
like it, because they,

1157
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,490
it's like helping them find
interesting stories.

1158
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,210
And you're more likely to
get, you know, leads

1159
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,070
back from entrepreneurs that
you help out.

1160
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:58,000
So, if you're interested in
learning more about press,

1161
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,449
here's two resources that I
really liked.

1162
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,380
Jason Kincaid, who was a
former TechCruch reporter,

1163
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,620
just a really, really great
overview that covers a lot

1164
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,270
of things I just talked
about, in more depth and

1165
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,390
from the, you know, blogger
side.

1166
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,720
That was a really great
book.

1167
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,170
And then kind of an evil
resource is this book

1168
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,500
Trust Me, I'm Lying.

1169
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,980
Which was written by the,

1170
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,420
one of the a former marketer
at American Apparel.

1171
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,560
And he talks about like a
lot of ways that he

1172
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,340
pretty like, evilly actually
manipulated the press, but

1173
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,440
I think it's a pretty good
look

1174
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,470
into like the psychology of
like how people, you know,

1175
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,030
things spread on the
internet.

1176
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,580
You know, how stories spread
on the internet and

1177
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,660
that, it's a.

1178
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,733
Might be valuable to take a
look at.

1179
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:44,668
Cool, that's, that's
basically it.

1180
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,380
One question?

1181
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,770
Just 1?
>> 2, 2.

1182
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,088
>> 2 que, Okay, 2 questions.

1183
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:55,829
Or zero questions.

1184
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,200
>> When is the right time to
start worrying about

1185
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,900
press altogether?

1186
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,720
>> When is the right time to

1187
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,420
start worrying about press
altogether?

1188
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,710
I think it's a really good
way.

1189
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,362
Like if you just.

1190
00:50:08,362 --> 00:50:09,898
The first time I launched,
you know,

1191
00:50:09,898 --> 00:50:11,530
my first products in our
first startup.

1192
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,570
For a lot of them we got
like zero attention.

1193
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,270
And we didn't really know
how to even get

1194
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:16,980
a hundred users.

1195
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,530
I think it's a really fine
way to

1196
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,220
get a hundred users and a
lot of.

1197
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,800
Companies in YC where they
first launch their

1198
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,340
product will encourage them
to get out and

1199
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,290
just do one TechCrunch story
to, like, get a few

1200
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,770
people to see it, and it's
good to get in the practice.

1201
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,260
I wouldn't, like, obsess
over getting, like,

1202
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,490
coverage in multiple outlets
or

1203
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,100
anything like that in the
very beginning.

1204
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,070
All right, anything else.

1205
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:37,930
There.

1206
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,400
>> It seems like

1207
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,710
the biggest story
>> Yeah.

1208
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:44,550
>> Great, so like much of a,
how much of

1209
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,945
a role did you guys actually
play in getting that

1210
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:51,773
out
>> so,

1211
00:50:51,773 --> 00:50:54,610
Twitch, you know, had this
thing called Twitch plays

1212
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,025
Pokemon where developers set
up like a Pokemon,

1213
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:59,840
like Gameboy game that was
controlled by chat, so

1214
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,240
millions of people would be
typing in A or B, and like.

1215
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,580
The character would wander,
wander around aimlessly.

1216
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,480
And that was like a huge
news story and I think that

1217
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,420
what we did was you know,
there's a couple parts.

1218
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,030
One, we set the stage by
having other news

1219
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,570
stories that, so when
someone from the BBC would

1220
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,330
Google like Twitch and be
like what is this

1221
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:22,090
crazy thing that everyone on
Reddit is talking about?

1222
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,637
They would, like, have some
context.

1223
00:51:23,637 --> 00:51:24,680
The other thing is,

1224
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,620
like, we didn't come up with
the idea for twit, right?

1225
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,280
That was, like fortuitous.

1226
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,020
But we helped, like, give it
legs by, you know,

1227
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,430
making the company available
to talk to the reporters,

1228
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,170
and, suggesting follow-up
stories about, like.

1229
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,255
You know, there were
stories,

1230
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:39,541
not just about Twitch plays
Pokemon,

1231
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,890
because a hundred thousand
people were watching this.

1232
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,590
Pokemon game, but because
you know, it finally like,

1233
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,550
there were stories when they
beat the game.

1234
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,370
And there were stories when
they launched Twitch

1235
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,300
plays Pokemon, you know,
Crystal, or

1236
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,200
whatever the next Pokemon
version was.

1237
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,900
And like, and so

1238
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,594
we kind of gave that story a
little more legs.

1239
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:58,260
But we didn't, you know,
originate it.

1240
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,896
It was the community really
who originated it.

1241
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:04,479
All right.

1242
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,970
I think that's it.

1243
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,010
Thank you very much.
