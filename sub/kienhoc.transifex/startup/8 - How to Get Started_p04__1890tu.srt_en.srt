748
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQOC-qy-GDY
How does it work?

749
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,980
It's something, this is kind
of like an abridged

750
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,910
version of what we talked
about at Y Combinator and

751
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,620
hopefully you guys will find
it helpful.

752
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,560
So, you know, a lot of
people,

753
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,840
I think when they first get
started with

754
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,090
entrepreneurship think about
getting press and being in

755
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,760
the press as something that
happens magically.

756
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,520
They think about it as like
something that,

757
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,620
you know, journalists out
there like,

758
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,090
trying to find the best
stories and

759
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,910
really, you know, like,
discover the,

760
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,520
like, it's like a
meritocracy which is like,

761
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,909
absolutely not the case.

762
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,360
So before you think about
press, one of the things you

763
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,890
really want to think about
is who you want to reach and

764
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,630
like what's you actual goal.

765
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,170
Right?
A lot of people,

766
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,470
like I know when I got
started I

767
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,850
wanted to just be in the
news because I

768
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,470
thought that's what like you
did as an important company.

769
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,440
And it turns out if you
don't have any goals

770
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,510
you're not gonna achieve
them.

771
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,600
Right?
I mean that's true of

772
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,570
pretty much everything and
with press,

773
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,930
if you just like, aimlessly
want to be covered,

774
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,910
it's not really going to do
anything for your start up.

775
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,500
So getting like, in the news
is nice because you can send

776
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,890
it to your mom or your, and
say hey, I have a real job.

777
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,420
You know, look, we're in the
New York Times.

778
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,990
But if you don't have a
actual goal for

779
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,320
your, like a business goal
with it,

780
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,550
it's really just like, not a
good use of time.

781
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,940
So, you know, there's many
different goals.

782
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,240
One example is, you know,
you might want to,

783
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,780
with Social Cam, which is a
spin off of Justin TV,

784
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,493
it was like an app that was
kind of

785
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:40,943
like video Instagram.

786
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:44,390
And our goal was really to
be known as a video,

787
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,600
like Instagram app, and

788
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,860
like be thought of in that
context when it was,

789
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,940
you know, time to pitch to
our,

790
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,176
like Silicon Valley
investors and influencers.

791
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,410
And so, we really wanted to
get in, like tech press and

792
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:59,242
kind of be positioned as
this new, hot social app.

793
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:04,390
With Exec, one of my goals
was a second,

794
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,430
like to get customers.

795
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,580
So, Exec was like,

796
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,440
a cleanings, local cleaning
service and

797
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,830
our goal was to get people
in San Francisco to use it.

798
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,394
It wasn't like useful to get
the national press because,

799
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:17,710
you know, 99% of those
people couldn't use it.

800
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,600
So, we really targeted
initially a lot of,

801
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,430
you know, like SF Chronicle,

802
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,720
and like local San Francisco
press that would directly

803
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,632
talk to people who could
potentially use our app.

804
00:35:26,632 --> 00:35:30,360
For Twitch which is probably
the thing that you

805
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,710
guys mostly know.

806
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,420
It was you know, Twitch was
ESPN for gaming or kind of

807
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,500
like a live streaming
community of gamers.

808
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,950
And our goal was to with
press was like to

809
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,500
reach the gaming industry.

810
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,130
Cuz like when we started now
it's like 55 million

811
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,980
uniques and

812
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,780
like people in the gaming
industry know about it.

813
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,810
But when we started nobody
really knew that like,

814
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,170
it was a place to advertise,
and

815
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,600
like, it wasn't like know as
like a, you know,

816
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,350
we were a very nascent small
gaming community.

817
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,190
And our goal was to like get
people in

818
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,060
the gaming industry, whether
they were developers or

819
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,230
advertisers, to think about
us as like

820
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,170
an important place where
influences were, so

821
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,330
we really targeted industry
trades and game depth logs.

822
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,730
Places where like gamers
wanna have games speed,

823
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,560
stuff like that, the
industry was reading.

824
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,100
So, you know,

825
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,210
what's an actual story, I
think there's, you know,

826
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,560
there's a bunch of different
types of stories but

827
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,346
these are usually the ones
that you see in,

828
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:26,030
you know, start ups.

829
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,170
Those are like product
launches,

830
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,610
like you let us launch a new
version of your app.

831
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,780
There's fundraising for

832
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,000
whatever reason, you know,
press loves to write about

833
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,390
fundraising even though it's
not very interesting.

834
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,660
So, you know like, if you
raise a $1 million

835
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,030
seaground, pretty much you
can get that covered.

836
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,205
Milestones or metrics like
you've achieved a $1 million

837
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:49,110
dollars a week in revenue,
that one of our, the,

838
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,440
the company that bought Exec
just announced that they,

839
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,390
they achieved a $1 million
dollars a week in

840
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,700
revenue and was covered
pretty widely.

841
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,646
Business stories which
generally happen when

842
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:01,220
you're already a successful
company.

843
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,355
Someone like New York Times
or New Yorker, business

844
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,530
magazine will wanna cover
the story of your start up.

845
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,030
Usually don't have to worry
about that in the beginning.

846
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,160
What I like to call stunts,
which are like,

847
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,520
I don't know if you guys
remember, but

848
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,320
a couple of years ago, this
YC company called WePay

849
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,120
dropped a block of ice with
money frozen in it, outside

850
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,680
of the PayPal like, a PayPal
developers conference.

851
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,860
Cuz they were like, PayPal
was like no, in the news for

852
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,560
freezing, you know, like
various developers accounts.

853
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,190
And so that was like, you
know, widely covered.

854
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,890
Because it was just so,

855
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,125
you know, kinda of an
interesting thing and

856
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:40,060
it really, it got them in
the story, right?

857
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,180
They wouldn't have been
talked about in

858
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,862
the context of PayPal, at
all really.

859
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:45,360
Hiring announcements,

860
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,350
if you're a big enough
company and

861
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,771
you hire someone really
important,

862
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:49,200
people will wanna cover
that, and

863
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,180
then contributed articles
like you writing some sort

864
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,240
of industry overview or some
opinion piece in like

865
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,830
maybe a tech blog or stuff
like that.

866
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,610
So those are like, you know,

867
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,870
basically any of those
things can be stories.

868
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,620
One of the things that
people usually don't

869
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,740
think about.

870
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,180
Is that, like, you really
have to think about,

871
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,090
like, everything, when you
start a start up,

872
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,800
you think that everything
you're doing is interesting.

873
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,370
But that's not true for,
like, other people.

874
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,380
Right?
Like, what you really need

875
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,800
to think about is, like,
objectively if I

876
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,570
wasn't the founder of this
company, would I wanna,

877
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,970
like, read a story about
what I'm pitching.

878
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,250
Right?
So, you know,

879
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,270
you have incremental feature
release or 2.01, you know,

880
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,740
feature release might not be
interesting.

881
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,950
Just because you added like,

882
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,070
you know, find your contacts
in Facebook or something.

883
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,510
Like you have, you really
want to take a step

884
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,580
back before you invest the
time in like actually trying

885
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,950
to pitch a story and think,
does anyone,

886
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,880
will anyone actually wanna
read this?

887
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,790
Because what people are, you
know, journalist and

888
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,730
bloggers are looking for,

889
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,529
is things that people
actually wanna read right?

890
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,090
The other thing is like,

891
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,750
you don't actually have to
be very original.

892
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,630
Your press in these doesn't
have to be original.

893
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,840
It just has to be like what
I like to call,

894
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,820
original enough, right?

895
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,386
So you don't wanna be the
second cooler company

896
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,980
To raise $5 million on
Kickstarter, right?

897
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,700
That's like.

898
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,780
That the first guy gets all
the news.

899
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,320
But like if you're there,

900
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,770
I think the first video game
console to

901
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,080
raise $10 million on
Kickstarter like Ouya was,

902
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,082
that was like, it was like
$1 million is 24 hours.

903
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:22,050
That was huge news because
they

904
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,240
were kinda like the first in
that category, right?

905
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,500
Even though other people
have raised a lot of

906
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,700
money on Kickstarter before.

907
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,150
So just like think about
your stories in

908
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,030
the context of like where
they are in

909
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,970
the like what else has been
written about and if

910
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,630
they're like kind of novel
enough and they haven't been

911
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,183
something that was like just
written about in the news.

912
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:44,406
So what are the actual
mechanics of

913
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:46,940
getting a story?

914
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,560
This is like pretty
tactical,

915
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,680
so what if you want to get
your news in, you know,

916
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,510
the press, basically there's
some easy, simple steps.

917
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,710
So it's basically, it's,
getting press is like,

918
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,120
you think of it like a sales
funnel.

919
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,600
So you're gonna talk to a
lot of people,

920
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,960
and not all of them are
gonna convert.

921
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,810
Right?
And so

922
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,950
you shouldn't be upset when
someone,

923
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,120
like one individual person
or reporter or

924
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,500
whatever doesn't write your
story.

925
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,210
The first thing is you have
to think of a story, right?

926
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,280
It's gotta be one of those,

927
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,370
probably one of those things
that I listed up before.

928
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,450
The second step is,

929
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,130
you wanna get introduced to
a reporter or multiple

930
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,791
reporters who are gonna
write about your thing.

931
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,829
It's like much, much easier,

932
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,697
just like any sort of
business development to

933
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:33,883
actually get in touch with
them through someone.

934
00:40:33,883 --> 00:40:37,590
It's like, you know, rather
than cold emailing them,

935
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:40,520
the best thing to do I've
found is like, you wanna

936
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,130
go to entrepreneurs who were
just written about,

937
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,690
like your friends who maybe
started a start up and

938
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,850
they were covered on
TechCrunch,

939
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,740
get them to introduce you to
your, you know,

940
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,990
that reporter who wrote
about them.

941
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,190
The reason that's good is
because like,

942
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,730
from the entrepreneur's
perspective, like

943
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,880
the easiest thing to do in
the world, is introduce you

944
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,200
to a reporter who already
wrote about them, right?

945
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,480
They don't, like need
anything else from

946
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,700
that reporter.

947
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,220
They're actually doing that
person a favor for

948
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,040
stories interesting.

949
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,020
It's not like you're asking
for

950
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,710
interest to investors, or
potential, you know,

951
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,421
people that they would wanna
hire, employees.

952
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,130
And then, from the
reporter's perspective,

953
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,790
they're getting intro to
someone who, you know,

954
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,280
they already vetted as
interesting.

955
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,200
Like, they're getting an
answer from someone who

956
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,860
they know they

957
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,460
thought was interesting
enough to talk about.

958
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,540
And so, like by the
transitive property

959
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,600
you're basically gonna,
they're gonna think you're,

960
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,650
you know, probably
interesting.

961
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,520
So you get like an email
that's like,

962
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,780
you know, from this guy that
introduces you to

963
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,300
the reporter, and

964
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,480
you want to get in contact
with them with enough time

965
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,200
that you can actually get
them to like write a story.

966
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,920
Probably a week in advance,
or more.

967
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
Because they're not gonna,
like, drop everything their

968
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,890
doing to just write about
your news.

969
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,755
So, a lot of people,
especially first time

970
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:51,990
entrepreneurs will come and
say,

971
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,430
like, Justin I'm watching
this product tomorrow.

972
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,210
Like, can you get me in
this, you know,

973
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,120
TechCrunch or something.

974
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,090
And that's, like, probably
not gonna happen unless you

975
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,440
already have a relationship.

976
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,640
The best way to do it, so
the best thing to do is,

977
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,850
like, give yourself some
lead time.

978
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,562
Get that intro in advance.

979
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:09,725
And then, so then you
should,

980
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:12,350
like, once you've set a date
for your news to go out,

981
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:15,100
you're gonna launch your
product, like in two weeks,

982
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,050
you have this intro, you set
up some sort of meeting and

983
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,260
you really wanna get the
reporter to,

984
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,440
like, invest time and effort
into you.

985
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,240
Because they don't,

986
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,670
like there's kind of a
sunk-cost fallacy at play.

987
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,210
Basically if you,

988
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,090
the more time they spend
with you, the more likely

989
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,400
they are to like actually
write something.

990
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,340
So you, the best thing to do
is to get a face to

991
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,940
face meeting.

992
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,170
Lots of people, report
bloggers actively don't want

993
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,702
to meet you face to face.

994
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:44,500
But like, if not that, then
get like a phone call,

995
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,660
right, and get on the phone
with them.

996
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,710
The worse thing to do is
like,
