499
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,740
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQOC-qy-GDY
I spend hours each night
reading every single tweet,

500
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,600
probably a little bit OCD,
but that's okay.

501
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,920
I read through all the
Teespring communities.

502
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,110
You're never gonna get a
better sense for

503
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,230
your product than actually
listening to real users, and

504
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,010
especially in the early
days, you're just,

505
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,440
the products you launch
with, and

506
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,400
the features set you launch
with, is almost certainly

507
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,370
not going to be the feature
set that you scale with and

508
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,080
the quicker you talk to
users and

509
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,010
learn what they actually
need,.

510
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,480
The faster you can get to
that point.

511
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,550
So there's three ways to
talk to your customers,

512
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,540
you can run customer service
yourself,

513
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:01,110
up until Teespring was doing
about $130-$140,000 a month

514
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,580
my co-founder Evan and

515
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,360
I did everything in customer
service.

516
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,660
This is one that there's
gonna be an instinct to

517
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,000
quickly pass off and that's
because it's painful.

518
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,990
Even today, when I open our
customer service

519
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,590
portal, I have like an
emotional reaction where my

520
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,060
stomach sinks because it
sucks talking to users

521
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,830
who have had a terrible
experience and it's painful.

522
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,790
It's something that you love
and you put so

523
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,260
much effort into and you've
gotten it wrong or

524
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,800
they've had a terrible
experience or

525
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
somebody didn't treat them
right.

526
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,010
But it's so important that
you go through that and

527
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,620
learn what you need to
build, what you need to fix.

528
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,160
The second step is to
proactively reach out

529
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,030
to current and churned
customers and

530
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,630
churned customers are
customers who have left, and

531
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,330
this is one that often falls
by the wayside in sort of.

532
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,850
The pursuit of new customers
but you wanna make sure that

533
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,190
your customers are having a
consistent, good experience.

534
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,300
You don't wanna just leave
those current users as

535
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,400
sort of, you don't want take
them for granted and

536
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,290
then when a user actually
leaves your service,.

537
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,170
You wanna reach out and

538
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,750
find out why both because
that personal outreach can

539
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,210
make the difference between
leaving and staying.

540
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,880
Sometimes people just need
to know that you care and

541
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,648
it's going to get better and

542
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:21,460
because even if you can't
bring them back

543
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,350
there's a chance that you
can learn from the mistake

544
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,930
that you made that caused
them to leave and fix it so

545
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,840
you don't churn users out
the same way in the future.

546
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,480
And the final one is, again,

547
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,810
the one that I'm probably
too OCD about, but

548
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,860
it's social media and
communities.

549
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,630
You need to know how

550
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,760
people are talking about
your brand.

551
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,070
You need to reach out and
make sure that,

552
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,830
when somebody does have a
bad experience and

553
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,940
they're talking about it,
that you make it right.

554
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,720
Problems are inevitable in
start-ups,

555
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,610
there's gonna be issues,

556
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,120
you're not gonna have the
perfect product,

557
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,770
things are gonna break,
things are gonna go wrong.

558
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,330
That's not important, what's
important is to

559
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:02,070
always make it right, to
always go the extra mile and

560
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,750
make that customer happy.

561
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,430
One detractor who has had a
terrible experience on your

562
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,870
platform is enough to
reverse the progress of

563
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,030
ten champions.

564
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,840
It's all it takes is one
person out there to say, no.

565
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,540
You shouldn't use those guys
for X, Y, and

566
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,920
Z reason, to ruin a ton of
momentum.

567
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,680
So even if it's there's
examples in the early

568
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,070
days where we would mess up
massive orders.

569
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,980
We would print the colors
slightly wrong,

570
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,670
it would be the wrong size
and

571
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,260
it would be like half of our
GMV for

572
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,550
that month and we would know
we got it wrong.

573
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,390
The customer would be
unhappy and

574
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,570
sort of this instinct is
well, it's only a little bit

575
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,360
off or it's not completely
wrong it'll be fine.

576
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,190
But the reality is you've
just got to bite the bullet

577
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,050
and make sure that's it
right, and those customers,

578
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,650
the customers that are often
originally the most

579
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,260
frustrated tend to turn into
the biggest champions and

580
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,479
the longest term users.

581
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,410
And the last one I

582
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,410
wanna talk about is finding
product and market fit and

583
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,790
what I mean that is that I
mentioned this earlier.

584
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,550
But the product you launch
with will almost certainly

585
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,090
not be the product that
takes you to scale and so

586
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,470
you're job in those early
moments or

587
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,450
those early days of a
start-up.

588
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,270
Is to progress and iterate
as fast as possible to reach

589
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,440
that product that does have
market fit and as engineers

590
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,250
you're instinct is gonna be
to build a platform with

591
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,090
beautiful clean code that
scales right?

592
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,239
You don't wanna write sort
of duct tape code that's

593
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:35,590
gonna pile on technical
debt.

594
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,710
But you need to optimize for
speed over scalability and

595
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,380
clean code and sort of an
example of this is,

596
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,790
in the early days,

597
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,870
we had a couple enterprise
customers come to us.

598
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,960
Sort of bigger non-profits
and

599
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,980
say, hey, we really like
your service but

600
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,650
you're missing these
fundamental things.

601
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,740
So we can't, we're not gonna
use it and we looked at sort

602
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,120
of what it would take to
build out those features and

603
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,920
we weren't sure they were
gonna work long-term, but

604
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,378
we wanted to try it.

605
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:05,860
And my co-founder Evan who
is our CTO and a million

606
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,680
times better developer than
I am, sort of run the map

607
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,470
and figured out that if we
did it the right way.

608
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,150
It was gonna take about a
month to build out

609
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,130
these features and

610
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,770
in a start-up, a month you
live in dog years.

611
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,240
A month is a year and that
just wasn't gonna do.

612
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,480
So he actually went out,
duplicated the code base,

613
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,970
duplicated the database and
was able to

614
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,840
basically build a completely
different product that he

615
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,280
didn't have to worry about
the existing users for,

616
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,180
to serve these enterprise
customers.

617
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,500
We gave them the tool,

618
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,570
they on-boarded, they
generate a lot of revenue.

619
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,210
Eventually, we learned what
features were core and

620
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,290
we integrated them into the
core product, but

621
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,940
what would have taken a
month,

622
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,730
we were able to do in three
to four days.

623
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,748
A great rule of thumb is to
only worry about the next

624
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:53,930
order of magnitude.

625
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,880
So when you have your tenth
user, you shouldn't be

626
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,210
wondering, well, how are we
gonna serve a million users.

627
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,040
You should be worried about
how are we gonna get to 100?

628
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,560
When you're at 100, you
should think about 1,000.

629
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,090
It's one of those things
where necessity is

630
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,830
the mother of invention of
all inventions.

631
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,710
So, when you hit that
breaking point, like

632
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,320
the Twitter Fail Whale is a
great example and Teespring.

633
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,330
There were months, month
stretches where

634
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,630
every single night, the site
would crash, every night and

635
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,660
during the day and every
single person on the team

636
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,830
would go to sleep with their
phone on loud under their

637
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,040
pillow so that inevitably,
when the buzzer went off,

638
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,920
we could quickly get up,
restart the servers and

639
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,260
go back to sleep and this
would happen daily.

640
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,610
But the reality is that it
was worth it and

641
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,230
you'll end up with these
huge pain points and

642
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,955
all this technical debt and
regret.

643
00:28:41,955 --> 00:28:46,400
But it's worth it, just to
get to that end goal and

644
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,970
that product fit faster, you
will make it work,

645
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,490
you will survive that those
sort of bumps are just speed

646
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,810
bumps and speed is so, so
important early.

647
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,470
So, the lesson that I've
been learning lately is

648
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,510
you want to do these things
that don't scale as long

649
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,210
as possible.

650
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,090
There's not some magical
moment,

651
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,080
it's not the series A, it's
not when you hit a certain

652
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,810
revenue milestone that you
stop doing things that

653
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,800
don't scale.

654
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,620
This is one of your biggest
advantages as a company,

655
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,510
and the moment you give it
up.

656
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,420
You're giving your
competitors that are smaller

657
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,540
that can still do things,
that advantage over you.

658
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,730
So, as long as humanly
possible,

659
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,180
as long as it is a net
positive,

660
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,870
you need to be spending time
talking to your users.

661
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,440
You need to move fast in
development,

662
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,420
as fast as possible.

663
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,260
But don't give it up
willingly, it should be

664
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,772
ripped from you, and so sort
of trying to practice what I

665
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:45,712
preach I wanna give you guys

00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,380
start a start up tee with
Sam.

673
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,140
And all proceeds are going
to Watsi.

674
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,460
I couldn't miss this
opportunity to sell.

675
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,570
So if you guys wanna grab
one of the official tees,

676
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,510
just go to
teespring.com/startup and

677
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,724
it's supporting a great
cause.

678
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:15,848
Thank you.

679
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,100
Sure.

680
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,840
Go ahead.

681
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,669
Yep.
The T-shirt printing

682
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:31,468
business, it seems like it
has a lot of So what made

683
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:33,643
you, what convinced you, to
think this is a viable

684
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:36,082
market even with all that's
going on in the world today?

685
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,250
Sure.

686
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,390
You know, so the question
was, the T-shirt printing

687
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,350
business has a lot of
competition.

688
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,550
What would convince us to
get into the market?

689
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,310
I think there's two factors
to it.

690
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,530
So first, I completely
agree.

691
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,940
From the outside, people
have been telling us

692
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,950
that this is a silly idea
since day one.

693
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,980
And sort of that every order
of magnitude we reach,

694
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,180
people will come and say
hey, that's a terrible,

695
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,370
terrible idea why are you
doing that?

696
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,370
But the reason that we
launched Teespring is

697
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,020
because we ran into a
personal pain point where we

698
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,830
had a need and we looked at
the current solutions.

699
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,090
I was a student at Brown,
and

700
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,770
I was trying to create a
remember the bar shirt for

701
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,720
a dive bar that got shut
down.

702
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,788
And I realized that nothing
needed,

703
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,960
nothing matched my needs.

704
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,310
And so, because I knew that
I had that pain point.

705
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,790
And I knew there was market
fit and

706
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,020
I had seen people adopt the
product.

707
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,900
I knew there was something
there and

708
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,720
it was also one of those
things where you,

709
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,050
you can sort of feel the,
you can sort of

710
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,370
feel the wind on your back
where people are adopting

711
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,900
the product quickly, the
pain point is clearly there.

712
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,320
It's not a met need.

713
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,100
So, I would say that
oftentimes great ideas start

714
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,850
by looking like silly ideas.

715
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,960
And then you can sort of
feel out whether or

716
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,910
not there's a scalable
business here by how people

717
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,980
are adopting it.

718
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,988
Is it possible to bring
customers aboard?

719
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:57,749
Sure.

720
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,840
Are non-profits your biggest
customer base, like?

721
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,110
No.
You know, today our

722
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,430
biggest customer base are
entrepreneurs who

723
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,860
are trying to build brands
and businesses.

724
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,510
You know, we have a little
over a 1,000 people that

725
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,710
make their full time living
on

726
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,490
Teespring today via brands
they've launched and

727
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,150
the other side is
influencers,

728
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,990
so YouTube stars, Reddit
communities, bloggers who

729
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,700
want to add product
merchandise as a way to sort

730
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,950
of create a brand and and
monetize that affinity.

731
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,490
So those are our two biggest
markets.

732
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,360
We still do work with a lot
of non-profits and

733
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,780
love working with them.

734
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
It's still a part of

735
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,520
our business just not the
majority.

736
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,200
Thank you.

737
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,700
Yeah.

738
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,624
All right, now we'll have
Justin talk.

739
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:48,669
Justin was the founder of
KeyCo, and then JustinTV,

740
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:52,674
which Twitch and is now and
he's going to talk about PR.

741
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:00,870
Cool.
Well, while I wait for

742
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,790
the slide to happen, I
started a bunch of startups

743
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,460
but I think you've heard a
lot of awesome, you know,

744
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,900
kind of how did I get
started stories.

745
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,180
So I'm gonna talk about
something very specific,

746
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,770
that people always have
questions with,

747
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,560
which is press and how do
you get it.
