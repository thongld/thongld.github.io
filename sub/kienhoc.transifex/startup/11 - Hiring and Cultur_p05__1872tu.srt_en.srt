1029
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Dl8rZ6qwE
And that could managing
people.

1030
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,970
It could be taking on a
project.

1031
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,520
But the implicit contract
with that is that if

1032
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,780
your going to ask somebody
to take a really big risk on

1033
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,720
that, it shouldn't be like
one-way through the door and

1034
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,380
if you don't succeed,

1035
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,545
otherwise it creates fright
to give it a shot.

1036
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:00,730
So we have some folks that
are managing large teams

1037
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,800
that started as individual
programmers, where they were

1038
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,680
engineering and they said
hey, I would love to try.

1039
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,220
I'd love to try leading a
project and

1040
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,970
then leading a group and

1041
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,940
then taking responsibility
for

1042
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,576
management, taking a group.

1043
00:41:10,576 --> 00:41:11,710
And we've had other folks
that tried it and

1044
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,130
they were like, I'm really
glad I tried it because I

1045
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,750
never wanna do that again.

1046
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,740
We try to make sure that,
for those people, like you

1047
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,660
can have just as much impact
at a company through your

1048
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,510
individual contributions as
an engineer or designer.

1049
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,130
You don't have to manage.

1050
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,640
But it's really hard to

1051
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,102
predict until you give
people a shot.

1052
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:30,800
And so my strong preference
is that you give as many

1053
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,140
people a shot as possible,
in the few areas where you

1054
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,070
really feel like there's too
much learning curve relative

1055
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,630
to the business objective
you're trying to achieve.

1056
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,750
That's when you look for
somebody who might be able

1057
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,470
to walk in and really
execute well in that job.

1058
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,910
Are you going to answer the
other question?

1059
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,100
>> Oh, so the question was

1060
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,170
how has the vision changed
since we initially started?

1061
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:59,364
>> Yes,
>> Sure,

1062
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:04,260
well I think on the vision,
when we first started,

1063
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,760
I think we started hiring
very inductively.

1064
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,300
We were like, oh, we're

1065
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,420
gonna build this really cool
tool.

1066
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,740
People are gonna enjoy it.

1067
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,690
I love collecting things.

1068
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,670
Maybe other people like
collecting things.

1069
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,100
And what we didn't expect,

1070
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,790
that kind of revealed itself
early on,

1071
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,750
was that looking at other
people's collections turns

1072
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,460
out to be this really
amazing way to discover

1073
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,730
things that you didn't know
you were looking for.

1074
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,839
It becomes kind of a
solution to a problem that

1075
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,790
a lot of other technologies
don't have.

1076
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,980
And so, over the last couple
years especially,

1077
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,340
we've poured enormous kind
of technical and design

1078
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,600
resources into building out
recommendations products,

1079
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,486
search products, feed
products.

1080
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:41,520
Leveraging the unique data
that we have which

1081
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,505
are these pins that were all
hand-picked by someone and

1082
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:45,190
hand-categorized.

1083
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,980
And then on the audience
side, the first big

1084
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,140
surprise was truthfully when
we first started,

1085
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,610
we didn't really know if
anyone would use it.

1086
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,890
And we were just happy that
anybody that wasn't related

1087
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,570
to us and

1088
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,930
obligated by familial
relationship would use it.

1089
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,190
And so one of the biggest
surprises has been how many

1090
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,662
people and how diverse those
groups of people have been.

1091
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:07,235
I think that's been one of

1092
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,554
the things that's really
exciting.

1093
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,290
And, the funny thing is,

1094
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,460
that is often like the
company goes farther along,

1095
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,162
your aspirations therefore
get bigger.

1096
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:19,440
So there's this gap that
always exists,

1097
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,840
I tell my team, between
where we are and

1098
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,910
where I think we should be,
and

1099
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,100
even though objectively,
we're much farther along,

1100
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,390
I feel like the gap has
widened even farther.

1101
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,290
But I think that's a really
common trait among

1102
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,795
people who found companies.

1103
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:34,197
>> Yes?

1104
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:35,348
>> You said that like,

1105
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:37,986
while selling a vision of
the company you had to

1106
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:38,731
describe and

1107
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:41,340
go into detail that how hard
it is going to be.

1108
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,290
And like they won't see
their families for

1109
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,650
three years but then they
will also get a thing that

1110
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,610
their grandchildren can be
proud of.

1111
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,050
But how do you really know?

1112
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,010
Both of you know that the
second part is

1113
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,680
not guaranteed but the first
part,

1114
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,200
if they're not gonna see
their family for

1115
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,380
the next year, it's gonna be
a different show.

1116
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,800
So like, how can you be
authentic by selling that

1117
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,514
vision of the company or is
it about giving high returns

1118
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,992
for the high risk they are
taking when the number of

1119
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:08,331
equity that already
>> Great question.

1120
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,565
So the question is,

1121
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,090
most start-ups are not the
iPhone.

1122
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,810
You can't guarantee that
people's grandchildren

1123
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,820
are gonna remember this
because most start-ups fail.

1124
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,180
How do you convince people
to sort of

1125
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,055
make sacrifices to join a
start-up?

1126
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,584
>> I think, part of the way
in which it resonates with

1127
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:29,660
people is because it's not
guaranteed, right?

1128
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,720
If it were guaranteed then
it'd be boring.

1129
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,784
And so it's that there is
the prospect of affecting

1130
00:44:36,784 --> 00:44:42,219
this outcome, but nothing
more than that potential.

1131
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:45,236
To the not seeing their
families or

1132
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:49,709
kids, start-ups often do
involve longer hours in

1133
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:52,945
the beginning, but I think,
well.

1134
00:44:52,945 --> 00:44:55,758
I, I think that that
particular story is

1135
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:58,160
probably somewhat
overstated.

1136
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,650
I guess, it was, I think

1137
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,490
Scott Forestall was trying
to recruit these people.

1138
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:05,830
But I mean, even though
startups,

1139
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,790
especially in the earlier
days,

1140
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,830
tend to involve somewhat
longer working hours.

1141
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,950
I think it was kind of this
tendency to,

1142
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,715
to exaggerate it.

1143
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:12,320
And sort of,

1144
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,550
I mean it's like the startup
version of fishing.

1145
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,460
Like, every startup thinks
they worked even more insane

1146
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,570
hours than, you know,

1147
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,530
the next one back in the
early days.

1148
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,450
Like, we literally never
sleep or slept rather,

1149
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:24,810
for two years.

1150
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,330
So I don't know.

1151
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,980
I think that realistically
for most people,

1152
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,350
it's not that big a
sacrifice, right?

1153
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:35,710
You're, maybe on average,
being really realistic about

1154
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,842
it, you'll work two hours
more on average per day.

1155
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:39,570
It's certainly a sacrifice,
but

1156
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,770
it is not forgoing all you
know, pleasure and

1157
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,820
enjoyment for the next half
decade.

1158
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,450
>> Yeah, I mean, I think
even the iPhone

1159
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,600
wasn't the iPhone before it
got done, right?

1160
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,890
I mean, no smart person
you're hiring is

1161
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,890
under the illusion that you
have a crystal ball into

1162
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,170
the future that only you
have, and

1163
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,550
that joining is a guaranteed
thing.

1164
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,590
And in fact, if you're
telling him that and

1165
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,520
they select in, you probably
shouldn't hire them.

1166
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,452
Because they,

1167
00:46:07,452 --> 00:46:10,394
they didn't pass like a
basic intelligence test

1168
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:12,992
about uncertainty in the
future.

1169
00:46:12,992 --> 00:46:15,436
But I, but I think it's fair
to say, like you know,

1170
00:46:15,436 --> 00:46:17,883
what's exciting and where
you think you can go, and

1171
00:46:17,883 --> 00:46:20,920
where it's going to be hard
and chart your best plan.

1172
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,144
And then tell them why their
role in it can be

1173
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,930
instrumental, because it is.

1174
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,090
You know I really liked what
you said.

1175
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,340
You know, if you tell people
like hey we're gonna go

1176
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,750
to Mars, it attracts the
best people and

1177
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,250
then you're incrementally
closer to getting to Mars.

1178
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,960
And they know that going in.

1179
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,630
What I would discourage
doing is

1180
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,720
just whitewashing all of
that.

1181
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,250
And if people kind of are
joining because they want

1182
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,200
sort of oh, I want all this
certainty and guarantee of

1183
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,520
working at Google, plus like
the perk of working in

1184
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
a small start up and more
email, and transparency.

1185
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,440
Like that's, that's a
really,

1186
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,365
really negative sign.

1187
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:57,210
And for

1188
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,330
example, when I interview
people they'll often say oh,

1189
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,620
I'm really passionate at
what you're doing, and

1190
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,030
then I'm like well, what
else are you interviewing?

1191
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,340
And then they'll just list
seven companies that have

1192
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,580
nothing to do with each
other except they're sort of

1193
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,861
at the same stage we're at.

1194
00:47:08,861 --> 00:47:09,916
They're like, you know,

1195
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,471
I love the problem of
discovery, so

1196
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:15,060
I'm interviewing at Stripe,
Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber.

1197
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,200
Now I'm also putting into my
resumé into Google X,

1198
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,730
into that part of the
division.

1199
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,960
And that's a sign that
they're probably not

1200
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,420
being authentic with which
they care about.

1201
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:21,940
>> Yeah.

1202
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,660
>> And those folks often,
when things get really hard,

1203
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,855
they won't stick it out and
work through it.

1204
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:28,480
Because they were really
signing up for

1205
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,520
an experience, not for
achieving a goal.

1206
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,650
>> I think the other thing
that motivates people

1207
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,650
a great deal, in addition to
the prospect of sort of

1208
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,797
them you know, affecting
some outcome is just sort of

1209
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:42,680
the personal development
angle.

1210
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,340
And that a start up,

1211
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,170
just because it's much, kind
of more lightly staffed.

1212
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,280
It's much less forgiving,
right?

1213
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,038
In that, like,

1214
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,099
even if you're the best
person in the world,

1215
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:54,249
if you're not going to.

1216
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,687
Well, whether or not you're
the best or

1217
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,550
the worst person in the
world, you're probably not

1218
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,835
going to significantly alter
Google's trajectory, right?

1219
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,860
Whereas if you sort of,

1220
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,810
really wanted to benchmark
yourself, and

1221
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,880
see how much a contribution
and an impact you can make.

1222
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,990
And I think that prospect is
quite compelling to a lot of

1223
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,350
the best people, then a
start up is

1224
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:18,120
a much better place to, to
go test that.

1225
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,660
>> All right.

1226
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,850
>> Last question, who'd you
want?

1227
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:22,280
Last question.

1228
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,670
So this question is for

1229
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,880
Ben, but you guys can all
answer it.

1230
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,590
But how has your user base
effected your

1231
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,540
hiring strategies?

1232
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,759
So Pinterest is a site
that's used like 80% by

1233
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:33,569
women, so

1234
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:36,700
how did that effect your
initial hiring decisions?

1235
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,020
>> How has your user base
effected your

1236
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,560
hiring strategy?

1237
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,690
>> Yes, so, You know,

1238
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,040
conventional wisdom is like
you only hire people that

1239
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,820
religiously use your product
every single day.

1240
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,010
And that probably works
really well if

1241
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,272
you're making an API,
probably amazing.

1242
00:48:50,272 --> 00:48:54,930
For us, we screen for people
that are ambitious and

1243
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,780
excited about the vision of
cracking discovery online.

1244
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,900
And they have to know
exactly how

1245
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,720
our service works and have
to have used it.

1246
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,490
But they may not be a
lifelong user.

1247
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,770
And that, for us it's this
great opportunity because we

1248
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,700
can be like, what is the
barrier that's

1249
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,270
preventing you from using
it?

1250
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,100
Come join, remove that
barrier,

1251
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,303
and help us get closer to
that vision.

1252
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:17,860
I don't know, there's a lot
of,

1253
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,420
if you read any sort of
book, there's all this

1254
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,050
startup wisdom that sounds
like really reasonable.

1255
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,200
But it's only useful if it
works in

1256
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,060
your particular
circumstance.

1257
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,340
And so for us, we've had to
sort of

1258
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,360
broaden the lens a little
bit in looking broadly about

1259
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,169
people that are ambitious
about the mission.

1260
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,620
That care about the product
and

1261
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,290
our approach to building
products,

1262
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,509
even if from day one, they
weren't our earliest users.

1263
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,140
>> The one thing I'll just
tack on to that is that when

1264
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,830
we talked about the fact
that, you know,

1265
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:48,500
it's really hard to hire for
those early employees.

1266
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,760
And you know, you have
people who have

1267
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,880
other good options.

1268
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,890
You're very much at the ugly
duckling stage.

1269
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,714
Finding people who are
passionate about your

1270
00:49:56,714 --> 00:49:58,399
product can be a great way
to find people.

1271
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:01,888
Because there you kind of
have an unnatural advantage

1272
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:03,443
over other companies.

1273
00:50:03,443 --> 00:50:04,784
And so I know, for

1274
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:09,258
sure, in Stripe's case, we
definitely, we hired I think

1275
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:13,690
it was four Stripe users in
the very early days.

1276
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,150
And you know, those were
people who,

1277
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,540
who we probably couldn't
have gotten otherwise.

1278
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,196
I'm sure it was the same in
Pinterest's case,

1279
00:50:21,196 --> 00:50:23,830
where you'll get all this
benefit of working at

1280
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,630
Pinterest and hey, it's
Pinterest.

1281
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,170
And you get to work where
you pin.

1282
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,469
Yeah.

1283
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:30,618
>> Thank you guys very much
for coming in today.

1284
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:33,140
>> Thank you.
