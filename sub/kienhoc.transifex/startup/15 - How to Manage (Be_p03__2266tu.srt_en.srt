591
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVhTvQXfibU
Like, that's just a done deal.

592
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,280
The second way to handle it,
which is,

593
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,720
and no companies do this.

594
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,920
Which is why I actually really
like this post that he wrote.

595
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,450
Like, you can say up front,
like,

596
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,590
you're guaranteed to get your
salary.

597
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,050
But for your stock to be
meaningful, like, this,

598
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,310
these are the things that have
to happen.

599
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,260
One, you've gotta vest.

600
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,870
Two, you have to stay until,
like, we get to an exit,

601
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,940
like the company makes it.

602
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,160
And or, like you've got to
have the money.

603
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,100
And like finally,

604
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,792
the company's like actually
got to be worth something.

605
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,310
because 10% of nothing is
nothing.

606
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,530
And look, the reason that we
set the policy this way is

607
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,230
like we really value people
who stay.

608
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,690
So don't join this company
like,

609
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,710
if you've got another, join
another one in 18 months.

610
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,390
because like, you're going to
get screwed.

611
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,230
And like, our policy like
guarantees you're going to get

612
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,490
screwed on that.

613
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,280
And so like, those are two
ways to handle it.

614
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,540
It really depends on like, you
and

615
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,790
how you want to run your
culture.

616
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,260
But again, with all these
things, it's just critical to

617
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,890
think it through from
everybody's perspective.

618
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,440
Because when push comes to
shove, that's going to matter.

619
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,390
It's going to change the
outcome of your company.

620
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,197
>> I'm actually revising my
recommendation slightly.

621
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:09,108
>> Let's hear it.

622
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:11,179
No, I just think there needs
to be more incentive to stay,

623
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:11,911
through the years.

624
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:12,635
But-
>> Right, so

625
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:14,080
you could add, you could add a
stay incentive.

626
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,336
>> But still like if someone
gets, if someone gets fired I

627
00:26:15,336 --> 00:26:16,415
still think they get screwed a
lot of the time.

628
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,370
>> Well the other.

629
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,510
And the other thing that's
really important that Sam

630
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,330
pointed out it's like,

631
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,590
the distinction now is how
much money you have, right?

632
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,240
If you've got the money, you
don't get screwed.

633
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,960
You walk away with all, you
can buy your stock.

634
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,790
You do take some risk, but you
can buy your stock.

635
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,970
If you don't have the money,
you don't have the money.

636
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,330
Okay.

637
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,680
So, now, we're getting to the
person on my shirt, Toussaint.

638
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,640
He was the best at this.

639
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,320
And I want to take you through
some examples,

640
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,170
because they're very powerful.

641
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,930
Okay so, first of all, about
Toussaint.

642
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,860
He was born, the thing to
understand about him is he,

643
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,300
he was born a slave.

644
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,650
And but he wasn't just born a
slave, he was born a slave

645
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,722
in the most brutal place to be
a slave.

646
00:26:57,722 --> 00:27:01,930
Which was in kind of the, then
the colony of Santo Domingo,

647
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,970
you know, now referred to as
Haiti.

648
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,170
But this was actually a much
more severe form of slavery,

649
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,050
as were, kind of,

650
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,880
all the sugar growing areas
than even US slavery.

651
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,090
Which is historically a very
brutal form of slavery.

652
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,273
And just to give you some
numbers on it, basically,

653
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:26,504
over the course of slavery,
the, something like 400 years,

654
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:29,755
a million slaves were brought
to the US.

655
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:33,159
And at the end of slavery
there were four million slaves

656
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:33,826
in the US.

657
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,176
In that same period,

658
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:38,330
to the sugar growing countries
in the Caribbean.

659
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,210
2 million slaves were brought
over.

660
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,346
And at the end of slavery,
there were 700,000 left.

661
00:27:43,346 --> 00:27:46,040
So from just a quantitative
perspective,

662
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,950
like nearly ten times more
brutal.

663
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,260
And I'm going to read this to
you.

664
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,020
I don't know if I quite have
time, but I don't care.

665
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,430
>> So but, just to, to give
you an idea,

666
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,880
this isn't just like a
quantitative thing.

667
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,043
I'll read you sort of a,

668
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:07,780
a description of slavery in
Toussaint's area.

669
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,470
Whipping was interrupted in
order to pass a piece of hot

670
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,360
wood on the buttocks of the
victim.

671
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,990
Salt, pepper, citron, cinders,
aloes and

672
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,690
hot ashes were poured into
bleeding wounds.

673
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,100
It's not to heal them, this is
to make it worse.

674
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,250
Mutilations were common.

675
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,920
Limbs, ears, and sometimes
private parts, to deprive them

676
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,330
of the pleasures which they
could indulge without expense.

677
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,380
Their masters poured burning
wa, wax on their arms and

678
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,330
hands and shoulders.

679
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,920
Emptied the boiling cane sugar
over their heads,

680
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,210
burning them alive.

681
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,970
Roasted them on slow fires,
filled them with gunpowder and

682
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,720
blew them up with a match.

683
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,900
Buried them up to their necks
and

684
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
smeared their heads with
sugar,

685
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,655
that the flies might devour
them.

686
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,540
Fastened them to the nests of
ants or wasps.

687
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,840
And made them eat their
excrement, drink their urine,

688
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,970
lick saliva of other slaves.

689
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,250
One colonist was known in
moments of anger to throw

690
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,330
himself onto slaves, and stick
his teeth into their flesh.

691
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,630
So that's the slavery that he
grew up in.

692
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,400
And it's really important to
understand this.

693
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,880
Because to get out of that
perspective, was not easy.

694
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,280
But he had a vision and his
vision was kind of threefold.

695
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,023
One, he wanted to end slavery.

696
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:13,102
Two, he wanted to actually
take control of

697
00:29:13,102 --> 00:29:14,727
the country and run the
country.

698
00:29:14,727 --> 00:29:17,345
And thirdly, he wanted it to
be a first class,

699
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,631
world class country.

700
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,504
Not just like something that,
where he had freed the slaves,

701
00:29:21,504 --> 00:29:24,630
but something that could
compete on a world wide basis.

702
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,110
And so that was his mindset
going in.

703
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,420
But that was the background
that he came from.

704
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,150
So example, management
example,

705
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,150
one conquering the enemy.

706
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,610
So, the kind of sequence of
battles that

707
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,650
occurred in Haiti.

708
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,472
Where first, you know, he had
to kind of defeat the locals.

709
00:29:40,472 --> 00:29:44,740
But then, once he defeated the
locals, which is,

710
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,790
there were several countries
that were very,

711
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,850
very interested in taking
control of Haiti.

712
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,780
Principally Spain, England and
France.

713
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,420
So he had to defeat those
armies as well.

714
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,650
When he conquered them, he had
to decide what

715
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,660
to do with the kind of
conquered soldiers, and

716
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,440
the leaders on the other side.

717
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,720
And, to do this, he really
took into perspective kind of,

718
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,060
three different points of
view.

719
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,870
One, his soldier's point of
view.

720
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,920
Two, the enemy's point of
view.

721
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,930
And finally, the point of view
of the resulting culture.

722
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,580
Like, what kind of country was
he building?

723
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,080
Because the army was going to
be the seed corn for

724
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,130
the culture of the whole
country.

725
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,310
So from the soldier's
perspective, I get this,

726
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,440
you know, do we get to
pillage?

727
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,300
Like, soldiers like to
pillage.

728
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,360
They get stuff, it's something
for their work.

729
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,740
And like, the second thing is,
they're trying to kill us,

730
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,950
so we should kill them.

731
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,750
Like, that's a basic
perspective of the people who

732
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,690
are fighting for 'em.

733
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,200
So, the most important people
to, to some.

734
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,720
Now, I put pillage up there
so, a couple things to note.

735
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,180
One, I didn't put rape up
there.

736
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,340
And very interestingly,

737
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,950
like not only did he not allow
rape among his army, but he

738
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,350
didn't even allow his officers
to cheat on their wives.

739
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,980
And if they did he'd get rid
of them.

740
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,140
Because he was so concerned
about the resulting culture.

741
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,110
What was it going to be?

742
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,320
Was it going to be productive?

743
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,200
Was it going to be best in
world?

744
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,100
Or was it going to be
something less than that?

745
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,040
And so that's, that was his
mindset going in.

746
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,520
His army was actually famous
for not pillaging.

747
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,060
So they were actually already
used to this,

748
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,990
they were famous for not
pillaging.

749
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,800
And this was a,

750
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,010
one of the most surprising
things to conquered people.

751
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:25,214
To the point where, in Haiti
he had a reputation when even

752
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:29,257
the white people were like,
very impressed with him.

753
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,539
Just because he would go in
and go into their city and

754
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,356
not pillage, even though he
would win.

755
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:34,635
But, again,

756
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:39,116
this is because he took a long
view of the culture.

757
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:43,569
So, and this is a kind of
important settle point,

758
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,650
which gets him to his
conclusion.

759
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,230
But he believed that the
culture of Haiti,

760
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,000
because it was a slave
culture,

761
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,350
sugar plantation culture, was
just pretty low

762
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,720
grade compared to what he had
experienced in Europe.

763
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,580
When he dealt with the
Europeans.

764
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,460
And then he thought that slave
culture was even more

765
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,620
broken than Haitian culture
because if you think about

766
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,260
slave culture it's like the
kind of culture where oh, you

767
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,750
don't do what I tell you, I'm
going to beat you to death.

768
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,310
I'm going to blow you up with
gunpowder.

769
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,160
If you think the kind of
behavior that,

770
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,500
that, then, that ensues from
that.

771
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,580
That was the culture he knew
he needed to replace.

772
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,090
He knew he needed to upgrade.

773
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,550
So his solution was, when he
conquered the British or

774
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,340
he conquered the Spanish or he
conquered the French.

775
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,250
He would take the very best
people from there.

776
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,784
And he would make them
generals in his army.

777
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:38,940
Okay, so, you probably didn't
expect that.

778
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,920
Like, so, here are the guys
trying to kill him.

779
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,410
He's leading a slave
revolution.

780
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,540
And he, when he conquers the
enemy,

781
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,090
he actually incorporates them
into his army, and

782
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,670
makes him part of that.

783
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,680
Because he wanted the
expertise, and he wanted the,

784
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,730
he wanted the culture to be at
a much higher level.

785
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:04,470
So the second question he had.

786
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,600
This is even more complicated.

787
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
What do you do with the slave
owners?

788
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,970
So you're leading a slave
revolution.

789
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,000
You take control of the
country.

790
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,269
What do you do with the slave
owners.

791
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,143
Three perspectives again.

792
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:23,317
So for the slaves, like, come
on, like if you're a slave and

793
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:25,945
you win the war against the
slave owners, like,

794
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:27,360
you want to kill them.

795
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,500
There is no question.

796
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,460
And not only do you want to
kill them,

797
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,760
but like that's your land now.

798
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,620
Like, we won.

799
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,280
Like F you.

800
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:39,160
From Toussaint's perspective,
it was more complicated

801
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,090
because he wanted Haiti to be
a first world country and

802
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,290
sugar was really important and

803
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,600
the whole slave economy was
the sugar economy.

804
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,500
Then, right, like, on the
other hand he was a slave and

805
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,110
he's got to be pretty upset,

806
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,660
particularly given the type of
slavery.

807
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,100
Then he had, but he had to
consider like,

808
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,300
he didn't know how to run a
sugar plantation.

809
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,430
And then like, he didn't have
any

810
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,980
business relationships on who
to trade the sugar with.

811
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,530
But on the other hand like,
like war,

812
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,140
like you win the war you get
the land.

813
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,060
Like, that's a pretty like
basic rule.

814
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,720
So what to do?

815
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,340
And then if you look at the
slave owner perspective, it's

816
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,120
pretty interesting because
they're coming at it from the,

817
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
and this is the point of

818
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,570
view that he actually had the
discipline to understand.

819
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,390
They were coming from a cost
structure that was

820
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,560
predicated on slave labor.

821
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,910
So, like,

822
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,910
their business didn't work
without slave labor.

823
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,630
Like, literally if they had to
pay people, like,

824
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,860
their cash flow wouldn't work.

825
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,560
They paid a lot of money for
the slaves up front.

826
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,060
And they paid a lot of money
for the land.

827
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,220
So in their mind, like, to run
it, like, that was, like,

828
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
that's how business worked.

829
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,290
Like, you can't just,

830
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,060
you can't just like change the
economics and

831
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,960
have it still work and then
they knew they had like

832
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,340
some power because of the
position they were in.

833
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,380
So what was the answer for the
slave owners?

834
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,740
So, one, so a solution was
like,

835
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,090
one, I'm going to end slavery,

836
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,610
two, I'm going to let slave
owners keep their land.

837
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,640
Three I'm going to make them
pay their workers.

838
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,050
So there are no more slave
labor.

839
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,070
You have paid workers.

840
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,117
But in order to fund that I'm
going to lower their taxes.

841
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,730
You guys ought to be kind of
impressed with that.

842
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,950
Like, lower the taxes of the
slave owners after you

843
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,170
defeat the slave owners and,
like, end slavery.

844
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,780
But he had a bigger goal.

845
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,670
He wanted a stronger culture.

846
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,310
The way he treated those slave
owners,

847
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,320
the, the need to keep the
economy going was important.

848
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,420
And then, like, let's look at
the results.

849
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,570
So, first of all, it is,

850
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,320
Toussaint's revolution is the
only successful slave rev,

851
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,240
revolution in the history of
mankind.

852
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,700
There's never been another
one.

853
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,270
There may never, hopefully.

854
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,270
We won't have slavery in a big
way, and

855
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,890
there won't be another one,
so, like, he's it.

856
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:06,680
Two you know, the plantation
owners kept their land.

857
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,660
Three, he defeated Napoleon.

858
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,720
He had a booming economy and a
world-class culture.

859
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,650
Under Toussaint, Haiti had
more exports,

860
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,460
export revenue than the United
States.

861
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,530
So that's how successful he
was in the revolution.

862
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,930
And this is the power of
looking at a situation not

863
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,330
just from your point of view,
but from the point of

864
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,210
view all the constituents,
even the people you hate.

865
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,300
Which is hard to do when
you're CEO, and

866
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,190
harder to do when you're
leading a revolution.

867
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,670
So just, look, in conclusion,
the most important thing that

868
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,690
you can learn as CEO, the, one
of the hardest things to

869
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,360
do is, you have to discipline
yourself to see your company

870
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,600
through the eyes of the people
that you're working through.

871
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,930
Through the eyes of the
employees,

872
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,760
through the eyes of your
partners.

873
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,100
Through the eyes of the people
who you're not talking to.

874
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,520
And who are not in the room.

875
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,106
Thank you.
Now for questions.

876
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:05,029
Yes, sir?

877
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,522
>> How do you communicate the
message to the rest of

878
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:19,401
the employees?

879
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:23,483
>> Right.

880
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:24,104
Right.

881
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:25,078
So this is a great question.

882
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,268
Yes.

883
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,660
So the question is,

884
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,690
so if you've gotta fire the
modern executive.

885
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,680
One, how do you have the
conversation.
