00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:02,670
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59ZQ-rf6iIc
Yeah?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,607
All right.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
god eftermiddag och vÃ¤lkomna till den sista klassen i hur man startar en startup

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:10,755
So this is

5
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,480
a little bit different than
every other class.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,390
Every other class has been
things that you should be

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,210
thinking about in general at
the beginning of a Startup.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,310
And today, we're going to talk
about things that you

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,080
don't have to think about for
a while.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,160
In fact, you shouldn't.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
But since, I'm not going to
get to talk to most of you,

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,620
again before you get to

13
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,570
sort of post-product market
fit stage.

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,330
I wanted to just give you the
list of things that

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,230
you need to think about as
your Startup scales, and

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,510
the list of the things that
usually.

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,070
Founder failed to make the
transition on.

18
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,260
So these are the topics we're
going to talk about but again

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,380
all of these things are things
that are not writing code or

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,690
talking to users.

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,680
Which means,

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,990
with a few exceptions that
I'll try to note, you can

23
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,946
ignore them until after you
have product market fit.

24
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,098
Most of these things, for most
companies,

25
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,492
become important between
months 12 and 24.

26
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,140
But it's really more about
stage than anything else.

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,220
These are things that usually
hit around 25 people and

28
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,920
definitely post product-market
fit.

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,750
So just write these down
somewhere and

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,860
look back at them when you get
there.

31
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,550
So the first area

32
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,490
we're going to talk about is
Management.

33
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,480
At the beginning of a company
there is no management, and

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,970
this actually works really
well.

35
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,400
Before 20 or 25 employees most
companies are structured with

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,450
everyone reporting to the
founder, it's totally flat.

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,940
And that's really good, and
that's what you want, and

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,440
at that stage that is the
optimal way, for product,

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,650
that's the optimal structure
for productivity.

40
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,400
But the thing that tricks
people is that when,

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,940
when lack of structure fails,
it fails all at once.

42
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,360
And so what works totally fine
at 20 employees,

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
is from zero to 20 employees?

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,360
Is disastrous at 30.

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,080
And so

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,900
you want to be aware that this
transition will happen.

47
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,950
And you don't actually need to

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,790
make the structure
complicated.

49
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,540
In fact, you shouldn't.

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,850
All you need is for every
employee to know,

51
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,170
who their manager is?

52
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,310
And every, and there should be
exactly one.

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,780
And, and every manager should
know,

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,800
who their direct reports are?

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,220
You want to ideally cluster
people in

56
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,880
teams that make sense of
course.

57
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,380
But the most important thing

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
is that there's just clear
reporting structure.

59
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,150
And that everyone knows, what
it is.

60
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,070
And if you want to make
changes to it people sort of

61
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,710
understand how to make changes
or to hire someone.

62
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,860
Clarity and simplicity are the
most important things here.

63
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,700
But failing to do it is really
bad.

64
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,610
So, because it works in the
early days to have no

65
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,940
structure at all,

66
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,970
and, because it sort of feels
cool to have no structure.

67
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,910
Many companies are like,

68
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,660
we're going to try this crazy
new management theory and

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,380
have no structure.

70
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,480
What you want to do is
innovate on your product and

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
your your business model?

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,450
Management structure is not,

73
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,590
where I would recommend trying
to innovate.

74
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,207
So, don't make the mistake of
having-

75
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:51,410
>>
>> Nothing but don't make

76
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,400
the other mistake of having
something super complicated.

77
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,190
A lot of people fall into this
trap,

78
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,940
where they think it's like you
know,

79
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,830
people feel cool if they're
someones manager.

80
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,370
And if they're just an
employee they don't feel cool.

81
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,130
So people come up with these
convoluted circular matrices

82
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,810
management structures, where
you report to this person for

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,090
this thing, and this person
for that thing, and

84
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,030
this person for that thing.

85
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,620
But you know,

86
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,470
actually this person reports
to you for this thing.

87
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,414
That's a mistake too.

88
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,880
So don't, don't try to
innovate here.

89
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,270
This is the first instance of
an important shift,

90
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,200
in companies, or in, in, in
the founders job.

91
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,410
Before product market fit your
only job that matters is to

92
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,270
build a great product, right,

93
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,750
you're number one job is to
build a great product.

94
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,420
As the company grows and

95
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,350
at about this, you know, 25 or
so employee size,

96
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,950
your main job shifts from
building a great product.

97
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,090
To building a great company,
and it stays there for

98
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,430
the rest of your time.

99
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,430
And this is probably the
biggest shift in being

100
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,220
a founder that ever happens.

101
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,200
There are four failure cases
we see all the time,

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,980
as founders become managers.

103
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,980
So I want to talk about the
four most common ones.

104
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,900
The first one is being afraid
to hire senior people.

105
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,420
In the early days of a
Startup,

106
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,310
hiring senior people is
usually a mistake.

107
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,850
You just want people that get
stuff done.

108
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,380
and, and the willingness to
work hard and

109
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,970
aptitude matters more than
experience.

110
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,210
As the company starts to
scale, and about this time

111
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,980
when you have to put in place
a basic management structure.

112
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,150
It is actually valuable to
have senior

113
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,780
people on the team.

114
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,390
You know, executives that have
built companies before.

115
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,110
And almost all founders after
the first time

116
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,650
they hire a really great
executive and

117
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,950
that executive takes over big
pieces of the business and

118
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,080
just makes them happen the
founder says, wow,

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,340
I wish I had done that
earlier.

120
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,700
But everybody makes this
mistake and

121
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,840
waits to long to do this, so

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,230
don't, don't be afraid to hire
senior executives.

123
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,560
The second mistake is hero
mode.

124
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,260
So, I will use the example of
say someone that

125
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,350
runs the customer service
team.

126
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,420
Someone runs the customer
service team,

127
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,680
they want to lead by example,
this starts from a good place,

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,270
it's, it's the extreme of
leading by example.

129
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,740
It's saying, you know what,

130
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,230
I want my team to work really
hard.

131
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,590
Rather than tell them to work
hard I'm going to

132
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,490
set an example and I'm
going to work 18 hours a day.

133
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,400
And I'm going to show people
how to get a lot of

134
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,900
tickets done.

135
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,600
But then the company starts
growing.

136
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,460
Also they have the normal
discomfort of assigning a lot

137
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,880
of work to other people.

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,820
So the company starts growing
and

139
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,170
the ticket volume, keeps going
up, and

140
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,730
now they have to do like 19
hours a day, and

141
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,950
then 20 hours a day, and it's
just obviously, not working.

142
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,660
But they won't stop and hire
people, because they're like,

143
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,820
if I stop, even for one day,

144
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,930
we're going to get behind on
tickets.

145
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,000
The only way to get out of
hero mode in this case is to

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,860
say, you know, what?

147
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,010
we're going to get behind on
tickets for two or

148
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,170
three weeks, because I'm
going to go off.

149
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,580
And I'm going to hire three
more support team members and

150
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,470
I've calculated based off our
growth rate that this is

151
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,880
going to last this long.

152
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,620
And next time,

153
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,820
I'm not going to make the same
mistake.

154
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,650
I'll get ahead of it and hire
again.

155
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,830
But you actually have to make
a tradeoff.

156
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,200
You actually, have to say, you
know, what?

157
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,250
I need to hire more people and

158
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,370
we're going to get behind on
other stuff.

159
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,510
That is the right answer.

160
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,300
The wrong answer is to stay in
hero mode until you burnout,

161
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,246
which is what most people do.

162
00:05:57,246 --> 00:06:01,750
Third mistake bad delegation.

163
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,900
Most founders have not managed
people before and

164
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,730
they certainly haven't managed
managers.

165
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,650
And so the way that the bad
way you delegate is you

166
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,790
say hey, employee, we need to
do this big thing.

167
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,230
You go off and research it.

168
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,710
Come back to me with all the
data and

169
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,000
the trade-offs, I'll make a
decision and tell it to you,

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,010
and then you'll go off and
implement it.

171
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,620
That's how most founders
delegate, and that does not

172
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,660
make people feel good and it
certainly doesn't scale.

173
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,410
A subtle difference but really
important is to say,

174
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,030
hey, you're really smart,
that's why I hired you.

175
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,969
You go off, here are the
things to think about,

176
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,064
here's what I think, but you
make this decision.

177
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,740
I totally trust you, and let
me know what you decide.

178
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,370
That's the delegation that
actually works.

179
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,490
because, I think, because
Steve Jobs was able to get

180
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,230
away with the former and make
every decision himself, and

181
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,660
people just put up with it.

182
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,440
And every founder thinks
they're the next Steve Jobs.

183
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,050
A lot of people try this.

184
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,500
But I, for 99.9% of people.

185
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,200
The second method here works a
lot better.

186
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,500
And then the fourth area is
just

187
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,730
a personal organization one.

188
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,590
When you are working on
product,

189
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,410
you don't actually need to be
that organized in terms of

190
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,520
how you run a company, and

191
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,200
how you talk to people about
what they're working on.

192
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,170
But if you fail to get your
own

193
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,010
personal organization system
right.

194
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,220
where you can keep track in
some way of what you need to

195
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,450
do, and what everybody else is
doing, and

196
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,960
what you need to follow up
with them on.

197
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,270
That will come back to bite
you,

198
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,330
so developing this early as
the company begins to

199
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,440
scale is really important.

200
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,850
Two other things that we hear
again and

201
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,260
again from our founders, they
wished they had done earlier.

202
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,460
And that is simply writing
down, how you do things?

203
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,440
And why you do things?

204
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,430
These two things, the how and
the why, are really important.

205
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,260
I mean early there is you just
tell everyone,

206
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,370
employee, when you're, like,

207
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,650
sitting around, having lunch
or dinner, you know?

208
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,280
This is how we think about
building products,

209
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,100
this is how we push
production, you know,

210
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,790
this is how we handle customer
support, whatever.

211
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,930
As you get bigger, you can't
keep doing that.

212
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,740
And if you don't do it,

213
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,580
someone else is just going to
say it.

214
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,870
But if you write it down, and
put it up on a Wiki or

215
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,330
whatever, that every employee
reads.

216
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,300
You as the founder get to
basically, write the law.

217
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,600
And, and if you write this
down it

218
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,450
will become law in the
company.

219
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,110
And if you make everyone read
this as the company hires 100

220
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,620
and then 1,000 employees
people will read this and

221
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,910
say, all right, that's how we
do things.

222
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,600
If you don't do it it will be
like random oral tradition of

223
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,660
whatever the hiring manager or
their best friend that

224
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,830
they make at their first week
in the company tells them.

225
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,680
So writing down how you do
things?

226
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,340
And the why?

227
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,590
The why is the culture of
values,

228
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,880
Brian Chesky talked about this
really well.

229
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,420
Every founder I know wishes
that they'd written down

230
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,930
both of these, the how and the
why, earlier.

231
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,470
To just establish it as the
company grows, and

232
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,990
then this becomes what
happens.

233
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,000
I think it's one of the
highest leverage

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,561
things that you can do that,
that people don't.

235
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,170
All right.
Next area, HR.

236
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,090
HR is another thing that most
people correctly ignore

237
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,080
in the first phase of a
Startup because again,

238
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,760
it's not writing code.

239
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,870
It's not talking to users.

240
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,530
But it's a huge mistake to
continue to ignore it.

241
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,070
And the reason that I think
most founders ignore it,

242
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,980
is they have in their mind
this idea of,

243
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,990
like TV sitcom HR, you know,
awfulness.

244
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,720
But it doesn't have to slow
you down.

245
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,420
Actually, it speeds you up.

246
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,690
Most founders will say, out of
one side of their mouth,

247
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,400
people are our most important
asset.

248
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,410
And, the other side, we don't
want any HR.

249
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,220
So, what they mean is, we
don't want HR.

250
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,900
We don't want, like, the bad
kind of TV HR.

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,460
What good HR means is, a few
things.

252
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,490
A clearer structure, which
Charlie talked about.

253
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,210
You know, a path for

254
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,950
people about, how they can
evolve their careers?

255
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,810
Most important, one

256
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,100
of the most important things
is Performance Feedback.

257
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,080
again, this happens
organically early on,

258
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,180
people know how they're doing.

259
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,870
As the company gets to 25, 30,

260
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,960
45 people, that gets lost and
it doesn't have to be complex.

261
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,530
It can be super simple but
there should be a way that it

262
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,740
happens and it shoulder be
frequent.

263
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,110
You know, people need to hear
pretty quickly,

264
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,170
how they're doing?

265
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,820
And it should tie you know, if
they're doing badly to a way

266
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,340
you get them out of the
company or if they,

267
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,430
they doing well it should
there should be

268
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,870
a clear path to how this ties
to compensation.

269
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,912
And that's the next thing.

270
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:20,629
In the early days of a
Startup.

271
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,146
People's compensation is
whatever they

272
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:24,321
negotiate with the founder,
and it's all over the place.

273
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,761
As you grow.

274
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:27,975
It feels hopelessly corporate,
but it really is

275
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,300
worth putting in place these
compensation bands.

276
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,077
So a midlevel engineer is in
this range.

277
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,000
A senior engineer's in this
range.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,950
Here's how you move from this
to this.

279
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,223
And it keeps things really
fair.

280
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,390
Someday everyone will find
that everyone else is comp.

281
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,540
If it's all over the place it

282
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,880
will be a complete meltdown
disaster.

283
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,780
If you put these bands in
place early.

284
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,590
It will at least be fair.

285
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,950
It will also save you a lot of
crazy negotiation.

286
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,870
One thing that I think is
really important when it comes

287
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,930
to HR is equity.

288
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,630
Most people get this right now
for

289
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,700
the early employees, they give
them a lot of equity.

290
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,120
But I think you should
continue to give a lot of

291
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
equity all the way through.

292
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,070
And, this is one place that

293
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,290
your investors will always
give you bad advice.

294
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,490
I think, not YC, but

295
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,164
all other investors give bad
advice here, most do.

296
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:15,410
You should be giving out a lot
of equity to your employees.

297
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,850
now, this dilutes everyone,
right,

298
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,000
this dilutes you as the
founder and

299
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,970
the investors equally.

300
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,690
For some reason,
