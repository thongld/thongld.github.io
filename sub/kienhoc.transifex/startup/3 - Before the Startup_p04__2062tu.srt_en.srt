892
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ
where people knowingly pay
high prices for

893
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,340
something in the hope that
they will be able to

894
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,640
unload it later on some
greater fool.

895
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,230
Right?
And

896
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,120
that's what happened in the
late 90s.

897
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,030
Like, VCs knowingly invested
in bullshit startups,

898
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,960
thinking that they would be

899
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,270
able to take those things
public, and unload them onto

900
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,240
the retail investors before
everything blew up.

901
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,330
And I was there, I was there
for

902
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,440
that, at the epicenter of it
all.

903
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
And that is not what's
happening today.

904
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,900
Prices are high, valuations
are high.

905
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,200
But valuations being high
does not mean a bubble.

906
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,560
Every, every commodity has
prices that go up and

907
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,740
down in some sort of sine
wave.

908
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,050
Definitely, prices are high.

909
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,950
And so we tell people, if
you raise money, don't think

910
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,090
the next time you raise
money it's gonna be so easy.

911
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,520
Who knows, maybe between now
and

912
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,090
then the Chinese economy
will have exploded and

913
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,110
there's another giant
disastrous recession.

914
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,814
Who knows, assume the worst,
but bubble, no.

915
00:37:51,814 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes?

916
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,728
>> I'm noticing a trend
among young people and

917
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:59,120
successful entrepreneurs,
where they don't want to

918
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,037
start one more great
company,

919
00:38:01,037 --> 00:38:02,892
they want to start like 20.

920
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:05,751
And so you're starting to
see the rise of these labs

921
00:38:05,751 --> 00:38:08,611
attempts where they're gonna
try to launch a bunch

922
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:09,440
of stuff.

923
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,130
I don't know a really
stellar example yet but.

924
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,150
>> Like ideal?

925
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,890
>> No like, like Idea lab,
like new one.

926
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,007
There's
>> Oh, yeah yeah.

927
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:25,723
So there's this new thing
where people start labs that

928
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,830
are supposed to spin off
startups, it might work.

929
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,940
That's how Twitter started.

930
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,570
In fact I meant Ideo Lab,

931
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,280
not Idea, that was another
Freudian slip.

932
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,640
Because Twitter was not
Twitter at first.

933
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,409
Twitter was the side
project.

934
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:44,525
Side project at a company
called Ideo that was

935
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,560
supposed to be in the
podcasting business.

936
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,916
You're like podcasting
business,

937
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,760
do those words even
grammatically fit together?

938
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,390
The answer turned out to be
no, as Evan discovered.

939
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,110
But like as a side project
they spun off Twitter and

940
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,340
boy was that a dog wagging
tail.

941
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,162
So people are starting these
things that are supposed to

942
00:39:03,162 --> 00:39:05,130
spin off startups, will it
work?

943
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,780
Quite possibly, quite
possibly,

944
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,950
if the right people do it.

945
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,720
You can't do it yet

946
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,380
though, cuz you have to do
it with your own money.

947
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,530
Yes, far back?

948
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,700
>> Thanks so much.

949
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,648
I hate to step into sort of
a gendered pitfall, but

950
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,191
what advice do you have for

951
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,940
female cofounders as they
pursuing funding?

952
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,570
>> Female cofounders when
you're pursuing funding,

953
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,720
well it probably is true
that women have

954
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,510
a harder time raising money,
right?

955
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,632
I've noticed this in
empirically, and,

956
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:34,760
Jessica is just about to
publish a bunch of

957
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,410
interviews with female
founders.

958
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,813
And a lot of them said that
they thought they had

959
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:41,810
a hard time, a harder time
raising money too.

960
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,443
So, what I would, you
remember I said,

961
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,642
like the way to raise money?

962
00:39:46,642 --> 00:39:49,020
Make your startup actually
do well.

963
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,720
Well, that's just especially
true in that case.

964
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,600
If have any, if you, if you
miss the ideal target

965
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,270
from the VC's point of view
in any respect, the way to

966
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,790
solve that problem is make
the startup do really well.

967
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,710
So in fact, there was a
point like a year or

968
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,510
two ago when I tweeted this
growth graph of this

969
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,100
company and I didn't say who
they were.

970
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,670
But I knew it would start
people asking and

971
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,230
it was actually a female
founded startup that was

972
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,400
having trouble raising money
but

973
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,110
their growth graphs were
stupendous.

974
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,361
And so I tweeted it, knowing
that, like, all these VC's

975
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:21,660
would start asking me who is
that, right?

976
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,090
And, like, growth graphs
have no gender, right?

977
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,690
So if they see the growth
graph first,

978
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,720
let them fall in love with
that.

979
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:29,710
Right?

980
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,959
So do well, which is good
advice for

981
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,021
startups generally.

982
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:32,909
Yes?

983
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:34,523
>> What would you learn in
college right now?

984
00:40:34,523 --> 00:40:35,152
>> What?

985
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,973
>> What would you learn in
college right now?

986
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:40,179
>> What would I learn in
college?

987
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:44,600
Hm, literary theory?

988
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,270
No, just kidding.

989
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:49,622
>> Let's see, well, you
know,

990
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:53,810
honestly, I think I might
try and study physics.

991
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,110
I feel that's the thing I
feel like I missed.

992
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,570
For some reason, like, I was
all excited,

993
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,980
when I was a kid, computers
were the thing,

994
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,200
maybe they still are, right?

995
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,740
So I sort of got very
excited about writing code.

996
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,490
And you could do things
with, you could do,

997
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,550
you could write real
programs in your bedroom.

998
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,750
You can't like, build real
linear accelerators.

999
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,390
Well maybe you can, so
maybe, physics.

1000
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,140
I feel kind of,

1001
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,990
I always, I have this, I
sort of look lon,

1002
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,150
I notice I sort of look
longingly at physics.

1003
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,540
So maybe.

1004
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,540
But I don't know if that's,
what am I saying?

1005
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,910
I'm saying, I was about to
say, I don't know if

1006
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,760
that's going to be helpful
starting a startup and

1007
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,550
I've just told you to follow
you own curiosity!

1008
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,770
So who cares if it's
helpful?

1009
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,850
It'll turn out to be
helpful.

1010
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,820
Questions?

1011
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,906
>> Another question online,

1012
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:38,794
what are your recurring
systems in your work and

1013
00:41:38,794 --> 00:41:40,407
personal life that make you
efficient?

1014
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:42,815
Oh, boy, Ookay.

1015
00:41:42,815 --> 00:41:45,524
So what are my recurring
systems in my work and

1016
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:47,890
personal life that make me
efficient?

1017
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,390
Well, having kids is a good
way to be efficient.

1018
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,350
Cuz you have no time left,
so if you wanna get anything

1019
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,480
done, the amount of done you
do per time is high.

1020
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:04,070
>> So, actually many
parents, many startup

1021
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,150
founders who have kids have
made that point explicitly.

1022
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,340
It causes you to focus,
because you have no choice.

1023
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,473
Let's see but that's not, I
wouldn't actually recommend

1024
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:20,301
you having kids, just to
have you more focused so,

1025
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:25,450
let's see, you know, I don't
think I'm very efficient.

1026
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,450
I have two ways of getting
work done.

1027
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,950
One is, like, during Y
Combinator,

1028
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,380
the way I worked on Y
Combinator was,

1029
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,080
I was forced to, right?

1030
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,980
Like, there was just,

1031
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,530
I had to set the application
deadline.

1032
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,250
And then people would apply,
and then there would be

1033
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,570
all of these applications
that I'd have to

1034
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,670
respond to by a certain
time, so I had to read them.

1035
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,560
And I knew if I

1036
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,630
read them badly we would get
bad startups, so

1037
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,370
I tried really hard to read
them well, right?

1038
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,930
So I set up this situation
that forced me to work.

1039
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,770
The other kind of work I do
is like writing essays.

1040
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,138
And I do that involuntarily.

1041
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,100
I'm like walking down the
street and

1042
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,445
the essay starts writing
itself in my head.

1043
00:42:57,445 --> 00:43:01,593
And so really I either force
myself to work on

1044
00:43:01,593 --> 00:43:04,059
less exciting things or,

1045
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:09,216
I can't help working on
exciting things, and I don't

1046
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:15,160
have any useful techniques
for making myself efficient.

1047
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,584
Sorry.

1048
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:18,427
If you work on things you
like you don't have to

1049
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:19,850
force yourself to be
efficient.

1050
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,227
Yes?
>> When do you think is

1051
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,570
a good time to turn a side
project into a startup?

1052
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,410
>> When is a good time to

1053
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,520
turn a side project into a
startup?

1054
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,328
You will know.

1055
00:43:28,328 --> 00:43:29,277
Right?

1056
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:31,933
>> What do has the
properties

1057
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,247
>> It starts, you,

1058
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:35,294
you when you okay,

1059
00:43:35,294 --> 00:43:37,782
the question is when you
turn a startup into,

1060
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,747
a side project into a real
startup.

1061
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:42,628
You will know that it's
becoming a real startup when

1062
00:43:42,628 --> 00:43:44,789
it takes over an alarming
percentage of

1063
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,922
your life, right?

1064
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,268
Like when you find like, my
God, I've just spent all day

1065
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:50,158
working on this thing that's
supposed to be

1066
00:43:50,158 --> 00:43:52,270
a side project, I'm gonna
fail all my classes.

1067
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,390
What am I gonna do?

1068
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,310
Right?

1069
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,070
Then maybe it's turning into
a startup.

1070
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,120
Yes?
Wait, I already answered

1071
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:58,970
your question.

1072
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,590
I should ask, I should let
somebody else ask one.

1073
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,690
I may get back to you.

1074
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,200
Yes?

1075
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,997
>> I, I know you talked a
lot earlier about

1076
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:06,350
you'll know when you start
doing extremely well.

1077
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,838
But I feel like in a lot of
cases,

1078
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,101
it's just you have a grey
line where it's like,

1079
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:11,865
hey you have some users but
maybe not as

1080
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:14,220
explosive growth chart as to
the right.

1081
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,970
What would you do?

1082
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,660
Or what would you recommend
doing in those

1083
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,490
situations specifically
allocating time and

1084
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,020
resources, how do you
balance in?

1085
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,830
>> Okay, when a startup is
sort of

1086
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,615
growing but not much.

1087
00:44:23,615 --> 00:44:25,650
>> Mm-hm.
>> Didn't you tell them

1088
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,970
they were supposed to redo
things that don't scale?

1089
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:28,870
>> Yeah.
>> You sir,

1090
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:29,970
have not done the readings.

1091
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,620
>> And you are busted
therefore.

1092
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,090
Because I wrote a whole
essay in answer to

1093
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:33,740
that question.

1094
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,610
That is it.

1095
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,010
Do things that don't scale.

1096
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,520
Just go read that.

1097
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,890
Cuz I can't remember
everything I said.

1098
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,139
>> But it's about exactly
that problem.

1099
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,780
>> Yes, back there.

1100
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,120
>> What kind of startup
should not go

1101
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,170
through incubation, in your
opinion?

1102
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:48,900
>> What kinda, you mean.

1103
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,640
>> Well, yeah.
>> Do you mean

1104
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,890
incubation YC?

1105
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,140
>> No, yeah, YC or.

1106
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,910
>> What kind of startup
should not through YC.

1107
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,014
Definitely any that will
fail.

1108
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:04,096
>> And, or, if you'll
succeed but

1109
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:07,562
you're an intolerable person
that also,

1110
00:45:07,562 --> 00:45:10,751
Sam would probably sooner do
without.

1111
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:13,039
Short of that, I cannot
think of any,

1112
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:15,400
because most, a large
percentage of,

1113
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,834
founders are often surprised
by how large a percentage of

1114
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:22,196
the problems that startups
have are the same regardless

1115
00:45:22,196 --> 00:45:24,796
of what kind of thing
they're working on.

1116
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:27,566
And those tend to be kind of
problems that YC helps with

1117
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:30,460
the most not the ones that
are domain specific.

1118
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,070
So I can’t, is there, can
you think of,

1119
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,990
class of startups that YC
wouldn't work for?

1120
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,740
I can't.

1121
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,400
I mean like we had fission
and

1122
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,190
fusion startups in the last
batch.

1123
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,170
Rather they had, yes?

1124
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,030
>> You mentioned that it's
good advice to

1125
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,750
learn a lot about something
that matters?

1126
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,020
>> Yes.
>> Some good strategies to

1127
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,970
figure out what matters?

1128
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,710
>> Well, If you think of,

1129
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,740
okay, so how do you figure
out what matters?

1130
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,970
If you think of technology
as something that's

1131
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:01,740
spreading as a sort of
fractal stain, anything on

1132
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,690
the edge represents an
interesting idea.

1133
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,350
It sounds familiar.

1134
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,160
So how do you figure out
hmm?

1135
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,850
Like I said, that was the
problem.

1136
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,160
You have correctly
identified,

1137
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,900
the thing where I didn't
really answer the question,

1138
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,810
where I gave this question
begging answer.

1139
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,650
I said, like I, just like,

1140
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,950
I'm interested in
interesting things.

1141
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,290
If you're interested in
interesting things,

1142
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,919
work on them and things will
all work out, right?

1143
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,620
But how do you tell what is
a real problem?

1144
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,432
I don't know.

1145
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:29,520
That's like important enough
to

1146
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,240
write a whole essay about,
and I don't know the answer.

1147
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,910
I probably should write
something about that.

1148
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:33,720
But I don't know!

1149
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,270
I don't know.

1150
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,590
I figured out a technique
for

1151
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,150
detecting whether you have a
taste for

1152
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,690
genuinely interesting
problems, which is whether

1153
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,540
you find working on boring
things intolerable, right?

1154
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,450
And there are known boring
things,

1155
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,000
like literary theory and

1156
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,430
working in middle management
in some large company.

1157
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,970
So if you could tolerate
those things,

1158
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:53,730
then you must not,

1159
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,130
you must either have
stupendous self discipline,

1160
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,930
or you don't have a taste
for

1161
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,740
genuinely interesting
problems, and vice versa.

1162
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,244
Yes?
>> One more question.

1163
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:04,899
>> Okay, one more question,
it better be good.

1164
00:47:04,899 --> 00:47:08,075
>> I was wondering out, you
know like Snapchat, like,

1165
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,210
makes money
>> Snapchat?

1166
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,124
What do I know about
Snapchat?

1167
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:15,069
>> We didn't fund them.

1168
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:18,380
How about another question?

1169
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,100
All right go ahead.

1170
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,010
>> You talked about hiring
employees you like.

1171
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,170
But it seems like that could
read into a monoculture, and

1172
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,190
there are a lot of benefits
in being a monoculture, but

1173
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,220
how do you feel about the
blind spots that arise?

1174
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,460
>> Okay, so if you hire
people who

1175
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,070
you like you might get a
monoculture, and

1176
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,700
how do you deal with the
blind spots that arise?

1177
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,748
Starting a startup is

1178
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:40,370
something where many things
will be going wrong.

1179
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,240
You can't expect it to be
perfect, and

1180
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,820
the advantages of hiring
people that you know and

1181
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,350
like are far greater than,
you know,

1182
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,070
the small disadvantages of
having some monoculture.

1183
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,050
You look at it empirically
all the most

1184
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,020
successful startups someone
just like hires all

1185
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,930
their pals out of college.

1186
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:07,370
All right you guys, thank
you.
