973
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,573
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7ZvO5DpIw
You mentioned that you're
taking longer then you'd like

974
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:09,570
to see growing and speak a
little bit about when,

975
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,419
how do you know whether or not
you should say and

976
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:16,437
how do you know when to give
up on also maybe with respect

977
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,467
to like your personalize life
and career goals.

978
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,350
How it fits in
>> So

979
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,590
the question is basically how
do you know when to pivot?

980
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,260
Part of the reason why having
investment thesis and

981
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,910
your confidence in your
investment thesis and

982
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,025
being pretty clear on that is,

983
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:34,940
generally speaking,the answer
that I give people is

984
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,100
if you're confidence is
unmeasured for a fairly long

985
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,820
time or is decreasing, cause
unmeasured for a fairly long

986
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,850
time should be decreasing and
it's decreasing.

987
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,160
And then you go into intense
mode where you're trying to

988
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,550
figure out what kinds of
things you would do

989
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,810
that would increase your
confidence.

990
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,110
Right, and that's failing.

991
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,350
That's a seriously good time
to think about pivoting Right.

992
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,680
And you might have thesis on
can we raise money.

993
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,700
You might have thesis on will,
what's the pattern by

994
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,350
which the product distribution
and growth or, you know,

995
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,300
viral limitation or SEO or
anything else will work.

996
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,250
And just like, well, I tried
these things and

997
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,670
this fourth thing doesn't seem
as good as these three and

998
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,430
the next two things that I
think about.

999
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,340
So even worse that begins to
decrease your confidence and

1000
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,510
that's when you should think
about pivoting.

1001
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,860
A frequent mistake when it
comes to pivoting is

1002
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,995
wait until you've essentially
been crashed into the wall and

1003
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:31,829
everything is dead and you
can't make any and you can't

1004
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,619
maneuver anymore and that's
you waited way too long.

1005
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,219
Now, in terms of personal
career goals and so

1006
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:41,533
forth, you know, part of the
thing that I

1007
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:45,889
would say that is one of the
things that I meant to talk to

1008
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:49,964
you during the slides that
since misread the time,

1009
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:52,658
I rushed through it a little
bit.

1010
00:41:52,658 --> 00:41:55,494
One of the classic questions
is balance and

1011
00:41:55,494 --> 00:41:58,910
I actually think founders have
no balance.

1012
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,540
Like one of the funniest
conversations I

1013
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,280
ever had was with a governor
of Colorado who was

1014
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,200
we're going to attract really
great entrepreneurs here

1015
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,517
because we have this balanced
lifestyle.

1016
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,800
Like, like literally if I ever
hear a founder talking about

1017
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,020
oh this is how I have a
balanced life and so.

1018
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,250
They're not committed to
winning, right?

1019
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,120
And so the only really great
founders are like,

1020
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,060
I am going to literally pour
everything into doing this.

1021
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,510
Now, it only may be for a
couple years.

1022
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,430
I may do this for a while,
then go do other things.

1023
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,532
But while I'm doing this, I am
unbalanced at this thing.

1024
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:29,087
It's not to say you don't take
breaks,

1025
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:31,051
not to say that you don't, you
know, go on dates or

1026
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,060
whatever else.

1027
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,160
But you're super focused on
this,

1028
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,340
because it's really hard, and
there's lots of ways to die.

1029
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,070
And that's the reason why the
jumping off the cliff

1030
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,050
metaphor is one of the ones
that I classically use.

1031
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,665
>> So your definition of
sorry, depends on

1032
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:48,504
the idea of identifying
uncertain opportunities which

1033
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:51,000
others don't necessarily see.

1034
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,740
Overall how efficient do you
think the startup ecosystem is

1035
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,300
at identifying good
opportunities?

1036
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,600
>> So how good is the startup
ecosystem at

1037
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,873
identifying contrarian
opportunities?

1038
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,610
Let's see.

1039
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,450
That's kind of challenge.

1040
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,710
Because the moment it

1041
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,760
kind of actually becomes in
vogue it's less contrarian.

1042
00:43:10,894 --> 00:43:13,660
I'd say it's mixed.

1043
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,316
Sometimes because part of what
makes a great investor is

1044
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:20,425
an ability to go look I take
this radical shot and

1045
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:22,153
I take this radical shot.

1046
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:24,687
I take this radical shot and
there's enough people or

1047
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:27,448
investors there's usually
someone, if you can find your

1048
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:30,340
way to them, network finding
your way through the network.

1049
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,810
Sometimes difficult, tons of
noise,

1050
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,630
hard to get to the signal.

1051
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,450
On the other hand there's
sometimes things that

1052
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,520
are just kind of like, you
know, totally crazy.

1053
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,270
Like one of the funniest
things is,

1054
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,920
you know Benchmark was the
only one that would fund eBay.

1055
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,900
You know, if you talk to most
of the people in

1056
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,180
the Valley a year, 18 months
ago about BitCoin they

1057
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,470
would've told you like what?

1058
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,110
Bit what?

1059
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,730
They have no idea what it is.

1060
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,490
And by the way,

1061
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,340
it's still unclear how BitCoin
will play out, although,

1062
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,340
I think, the fact that there
will be a distributed

1063
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,950
trust system on cryptocurrency
is I think almost certainly

1064
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,910
going to exist in the world,
and the real question is,

1065
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,700
is BitCoin the first or last
cryptocurrency.

1066
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,490
First, there's new ones and
new features.

1067
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:10,570
Last because it's the one that
has

1068
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,368
network effects and is already
going.

1069
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:14,181
And so.

1070
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,740
I think it's pretty good with
it.

1071
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,570
Frequently what happens is
people think

1072
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,770
they're contrarian because
they're doing something they

1073
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,420
think is a unique con-,

1074
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,590
unique combination.

1075
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,920
I'll give you two examples and
hopefully the,

1076
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,160
the founders of these people
who sent me these cool,

1077
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,420
I get about 30 pictures sent
to me a day.

1078
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,530
That I don't basically don't
look at unless or

1079
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,010
if something in the title
makes me laugh.

1080
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,270
In which case I look at it
mostly as comedy.

1081
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,090
And I'll share two comedy
ones.

1082
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:48,280
One of them was wearable
diapers, which was the you

1083
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,380
know, you, you have the
computer monitoring you know.

1084
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,340
Whether or not the kid is you
know taking a pee or

1085
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,170
a poop and it lets you know,
and you're like.

1086
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,310
If you're that far away from
your child in this kind of

1087
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,917
thing, it's probably a bad
sign of other things.

1088
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:03,801
And then the other one was
kind of

1089
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,512
a customized e-commerce bongs.

1090
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,040
And your know like, oh, I've
got a contrarian idea.

1091
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,510
Like, yes you do.

1092
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,110
But not the right way.

1093
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,240
Right?
So anyway.

1094
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,740
So, you know, but, so I think
generally speaking,

1095
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,710
the system's pretty good at
it.

1096
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,951
In the back.

1097
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,210
>> Do you find social net
ahead of time I guess.

1098
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,040
How do you think about
creating markets versus.

1099
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,713
>> Creating markets versus
discovering them?

1100
00:45:25,713 --> 00:45:26,672
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

1101
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:30,810
So this is actually, well,
it's a challenging question.

1102
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,780
The, the the, the frequent,
like, and there's a,

1103
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,760
and it's a good follow on the
contrarian thing,

1104
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,040
like frequently there's this
classic thing of,

1105
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,270
oh does the market exist yet?

1106
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,320
Is that because it's going to
be huge or nonexistent?

1107
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,730
The good news is, it's usually
one or the other.

1108
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,510
Right?

1109
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,620
And so that makes going after
something that most people

1110
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,600
don't think is a market, but

1111
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,690
you have a reason to believe
it,

1112
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,570
is actually sometimes
frequently a good bet.

1113
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,540
However it can freq,

1114
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,290
it can sometimes completely
flame out.

1115
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,100
And one of the things you're
doing when you're testing your

1116
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,580
investment thesis is.

1117
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,650
What would lead me to

1118
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,010
think whether there was a
market there or not?

1119
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,360
Because, you know,

1120
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,800
at the beginning there are no
markets.

1121
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,690
And so it is of course
conceptually possible to

1122
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,230
create markets.

1123
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,370
People think that there's a
new need for

1124
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,540
this sort of thing.

1125
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,120
On the other hand,

1126
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,460
the problem is how do you get
fast adoption if people don't

1127
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,950
even know that they want it as
a category.

1128
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,600
Right?

1129
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,920
So they say, well, but people,

1130
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,470
they just realize, a classic
entrepreneurial misfire.

1131
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,800
A classic one is if people
just realize once it

1132
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,780
exists they'll realize they
really love it and

1133
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,860
they'll, they'll line up in
droves for it.

1134
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,240
Well, there's a few
entrepreneurs,

1135
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,570
Steve Jobs one of them, who
can do that.

1136
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,750
Most of the time it doesn't
work out that way, and so

1137
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,390
you have to say in your
investment thesis why is

1138
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,150
it that you think when you're
thinking about a market that

1139
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,100
isn't already existent.

1140
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,600
That, that you know that other
people don't know on

1141
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,560
the countrian basis that leads
you to

1142
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,290
think that market should
exist, right.

1143
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,420
And so for example, a micro
one with LinkedIn was,

1144
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,080
actually in fact the
classifieds means of

1145
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,070
recruiting was in fact an
exercise of newspapers,

1146
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,060
an exercise in information
age.

1147
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,380
And actually, recruiting
direct to people is part of

1148
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,180
what the networked age, and
the internet and

1149
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,800
that's actually, in fact, how
recruiting should go.

1150
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,010
Now, it was relatively easy to
validate that.

1151
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,820
But, you know,

1152
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,150
that's the kind of thing where
you think about,

1153
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,190
there's potentially a new
market.

1154
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,240
>> Last question, boss.

1155
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,080
>> Yeah, last question.

1156
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,080
>> When do you know you've
known someone long enough to

1157
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,890
start a company in front of?

1158
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,030
One of the things Stan told us
a in the first semester was

1159
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,740
you someone you know for a but
when you guys started PayPal.

1160
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,238
Like, for example, how long
did you,

1161
00:47:33,238 --> 00:47:36,568
it was a large group of people
so how do you know okay,

1162
00:47:36,568 --> 00:47:39,474
I trust the people enough to
start a company.

1163
00:47:39,474 --> 00:47:41,456
>> So the read I'm, I'm, I'm
repeating the question in

1164
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:43,312
part because we're, this is
record, recorded and

1165
00:47:43,312 --> 00:47:45,379
everything else and I want to
make sure the people here it,

1166
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:47,233
but the question basically is
how do you know that you

1167
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:49,490
trust someone well enough to
be a cofounder.

1168
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:51,270
There's a whole bunch of
different variables that go

1169
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,000
into it and, look, it's one of
the risks that you take.

1170
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,780
And you kind of get to a
thesis of do I think that I

1171
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,570
know them well enough?

1172
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,360
Now I'll parallel one thing
that I think

1173
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,010
there's a parallel here that I
think is super useful.

1174
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,130
So one of the things I tell my
portfolio company CEOs or

1175
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,060
founders when there thinking
about hiring a CEO.

1176
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,270
Is I think that the only way
to do this is,

1177
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,350
when you get down to the
people that you thinking you

1178
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,160
may hire as a CEO, you spend
20 plus hours which them.

1179
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,690
Right, where you go into as
much depth in a conversation

1180
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,510
about anything you think is a
possible difference.

1181
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,710
Of opinion, belief, work
style, so

1182
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,720
you've identified all this up
front so that you're, you're,

1183
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,960
you're it's not that you have
a contract, it's not like,

1184
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,120
oh signing a contract, this is
how we do it.

1185
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,910
But we've established the
conversation.

1186
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,830
We've, we've gone all the
parameters,

1187
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,420
we've had a conversion about
what we might agree with or

1188
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,570
disagree with.

1189
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,680
One of the things that I
frequently think is

1190
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,960
worth covering is almost like,
kind of, the divorce.

1191
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,480
Like, wa, why would we want to
divorce?

1192
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,770
Like, what would lead me to
say,

1193
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,350
this isn't working, right?

1194
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,230
And to cover that up front as
part of it.

1195
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,960
Because then, at that point,

1196
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,510
when you get into the field of
battle.

1197
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,720
Which is hugely stressful,

1198
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,600
you go through this valley
shadow of the moment.

1199
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,030
You've at least got the basis
of we already conversed about

1200
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,690
a wide variety of things we've
set up essentially some

1201
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,960
expectations about what, you
know how we might be planning

1202
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,790
together, and if it begins to
vary off that it's relatively

1203
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,070
easy to bring it up in a way
that you're problem solving.

1204
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,210
And that's the kind of thing
that I think you frequently,

1205
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,040
you should be fairly confident
that you

1206
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,820
have that level of trust.

1207
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,920
For me, frequently,

1208
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,320
it's to have a set of robust
conversations.

1209
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,370
Such that, as like, like if
something comes up later,

1210
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,240
it's like, well, we talked
about this inversion.

1211
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,300
And we can, we can bring that
up, so.

1212
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,780
Anyway, with that.

1213
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,690
>> Thank you very much.

1214
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,190
>> Thank you.
