551
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,640
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHzvmyMJEK4
people who understand what
they're getting into,

552
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,340
and understand what you're
getting into in terms of

553
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,110
future dilution.

554
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,780
>> Okay.

555
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,140
So you're raising money, you
understand what you're

556
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,270
selling, you figured out the
price,

557
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,120
you've got down the logistics
that Kirstie just described.

558
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,190
But what you may find is that
you don't understand some of

559
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,480
the terms and terminology that
your investors are using.

560
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,670
And this okay, but

561
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,980
you have a burden to go figure
that stuff out.

562
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,410
Don't assume that just because
you've agreed on the valuation

563
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,330
of the price that all the
other stuff doesn't matter,

564
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,750
because it does matter, and
you need to know how these

565
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,805
terms are going to impact your
company in the long run.

566
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:58,070
At Y Combinator Chris and

567
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,770
I hear founders say all the
time, I didn't know

568
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,350
what that was, I didn't know
what I was signing, you know?

569
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,850
I, I didn't know I agreed to
that.

570
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,650
So, really, the burden is on
you to figure this,

571
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,690
to figure this stuff out.

572
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,510
And we're going to go over
four common investor requests.

573
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,800
So, the first one is, board
seat.

574
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
Some investors will ask for

575
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,840
a seat on your company's board
of directors.

576
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,920
And the investor usually wants
to be a director,

577
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,840
either because he or

578
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,560
she really wants to keep tabs
on their money.

579
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,770
Or because he or

580
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,500
she really thinks they can
help you run your business.

581
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,050
And you have to be

582
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,630
really careful about adding an
investor to your board.

583
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,900
In most cases, you want to say
no.

584
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,240
Otherwise, make sure it's

585
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,060
a person who's really going to
add value.

586
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,660
Having money is very valuable,
but someone who really helps

587
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,450
with strategy and direction is
priceless, so choose wisely.

588
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
The other thing, is advisors.

589
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,850
There are so many people who
want to give advice to

590
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,895
startups, and so few people
who actually give good advice.

591
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,150
Once an investor has given
your company money,

592
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,510
that person should be a
defacto advisor.

593
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,380
But without any official
title, and

594
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,290
more importantly without the
company having to

595
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,835
give anything extra in return
for the advice.

596
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,110
So here's an example.

597
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:13,440
At Y Combinator we've noticed
that

598
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,440
whenever a startup manages to
garner a celebrity investor,

599
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,880
the celebrity almost always
asks to be an advisor.

600
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,330
We have a company that
provides on demand bodyguard

601
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,980
services, and an MBA
basketball player invested.

602
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,840
Ask to be an advisor, and then
asked to be given shares of

603
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,570
common stock in exchange for
the advisor services.

604
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,670
And the services that this
person had in mind,

605
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,270
this investor had in mind,
would be to introduce his

606
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,120
company around to all the
other professional basketball

607
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,319
players who might want to use
an on demand bodyguard.

608
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,040
But, this celebrity just made
a big investment.

609
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,150
Shouldn't he want to help the
company succeed anyway?

610
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,290
Why does he need something
extra?

611
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,740
All investors who can help,
should do so.

612
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,300
Asking for additional shares
is

613
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,860
just an investor looking for a
freebie.

614
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,800
Okay, next we're going to talk
about pro-rata rights.

615
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,090
What are pro-rata rights.

616
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,490
Some of you may have heard of
this before.

617
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,540
But, very simply its the right
to maintain your

618
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,030
percentage ownership in a
company by buying more shares

619
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,585
in the company in the future.

620
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:17,920
Pro-rata rights are a way to
avoid dilution, and

621
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,350
dilution in this context means
owning less and

622
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,460
less of the company each time
the company sells more stock

623
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,340
to other investors.

624
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,640
So, this is a really basic
example but,

625
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,370
say an early investor buys
shares of preferred stock and

626
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,980
ends up owning 3% of the
company once the financing

627
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,830
has closed.

628
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,210
And the company raises another
round of financing, and

629
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,890
the company will go to this
investor who negotiated and

630
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,290
got pro-rata rights and say,
hey, we're raising more money.

631
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,170
So you're welcome to buy,

632
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,050
you know, this many shares in
the new round to keep your

633
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,631
ownership at approximately 3%,

634
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,962
that is pro-rata rights at
their very most basic.

635
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,920
So pro-rata rights are a very
common request for,

636
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,070
from investors, and they are
not necessarily a bad thing.

637
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,480
But you absolutely as

638
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,691
a founder need to know how
pro-rata rights work.

639
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,960
Especially because, Kirstie
touched on this a little bit.

640
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,060
The corollary to an investor
having pro-rata

641
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,130
rights to avoid dilution,

642
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,800
is that the founders typically
suffer greater dilution.

643
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,270
The final thing is information
rights.

644
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,000
Investors almost always want

645
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,940
contractual information rights
about,

646
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,760
to get certain information
about your company.

647
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,650
Giving periodic information
and

648
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,180
status updates is not a bad
thing.

649
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,230
In fact at YC we encourage
companies to

650
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,030
give monthly updates to their
investors, because

651
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,800
it's a great opportunity to
ask for help for

652
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,440
your, from your investors,
like introductions or

653
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,830
help with hiring, that kind of
thing.

654
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,540
But you have to be really
careful about overreach.

655
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,620
And the investor who's saying
they want like a month budget,

656
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,426
or a weekly update, that's not
okay.

657
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:55,420
So the take-away here is that
just because

658
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,550
the type of financing and the
valuation has been negotiated,

659
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,030
doesn't mean that everything
else is unimportant.

660
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,080
You need to know everything
about your financing.

661
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,270
>> Okay, so then moving on to
after you've got that money.

662
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,711
You know, you've raised some
money the, the company bank

663
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,030
accounts probably showing more
zeros than at,

664
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,080
than you've ever seen in your
life.

665
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,980
So, so then what?

666
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,000
This is where

667
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,030
you actually start incurring
business expenses.

668
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,740
And business expenses are the
cost of carrying out

669
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,810
your business.

670
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,500
So things like paying
employees paying rent for

671
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,060
an office, hosting costs,
acquiring customers,

672
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,870
that kind of thing.

673
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,900
And business expenses are
important,

674
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,650
because they get deducted on
the company's tax return

675
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,340
to offset any revenues that
are made to

676
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,810
lower the taxes that the
company pays.

677
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,610
And on the flip side,

678
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,660
if it's a non-business expense
that the company incurs,

679
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,180
then that is not deductible on
the tax return, so

680
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,870
that can increase the profits
that the company then have to

681
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,460
pay tax on.

682
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,050
So, again, this is, this is a
separation issue.

683
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,380
The company will have its own
bank accounts, and

684
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,260
that's where the company's
expenses should be paid

685
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,770
out of.

686
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,620
again, you know, thinking
about this from a,

687
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,940
from a large company, if you
were working at Google,

688
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,960
you would not use a Google
credit card to buy

689
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,150
a toothbrush and toothpaste.

690
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,790
So the other thing to remember
is that, you know,

691
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,610
the investors gave you this
money.

692
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,600
They trusted you with all
these huge amounts of, of,

693
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,500
of money, and they want you to

694
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,619
use that money to make the
company a success.

695
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,500
It's not your money for you to
spend how you please.

696
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,000
And believe me, we've had some
horror stories of founders who

697
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,940
take that approach.

698
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,960
We had, we had one founder
that we knew of who took

699
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,620
investor money and went off to
Vegas.

700
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,979
And boy by his Facebook photos
did he have a good time.

701
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,290
Needless to say he's no longer
with the company.

702
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,440
But really this is, this is
stealing from the investors.

703
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:07,571
You know, think about it the,
the concept of business

704
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:10,782
expenses can get a little bit
blurry especially in

705
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:13,766
the early days when you're
working outside,

706
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:17,687
working in your apartment and
your working 24 hours a day.

707
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,590
But the way to think about it
is,

708
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,046
if an investor asked me what
I'd spent their money on, and

709
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:25,795
I have to give a line by line
breakdown of that,

710
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:28,686
would I be embarrassed about
telling any of the,

711
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,245
telling them what any of those
lines were?

712
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:36,725
And if you were, it's probably
not a business expense.

713
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:39,853
So, the other thing to bear in
mind is that, you know,

714
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:43,117
you're busy running your
company at 90 miles an hour,

715
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:44,760
just constant, constant.

716
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880
So you don't have to
necessarily think about

717
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,950
the bookkeeping and accounting
at that point, but it's really

718
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,710
crucial that you do keep the
receipts, so that when you do

719
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,500
engage a bookkeeper or a CPA
to prepare your tax returns.

720
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,302
They can unpick all of this
and

721
00:32:00,302 --> 00:32:02,460
they can figure out what are
business expenses and

722
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,550
what aren't business expenses.

723
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,840
But they're going to need your
help as a founder, because

724
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,110
they aren't going to know what
all these things are.

725
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,180
So, there is some involvement
from you and the way to

726
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,760
make the involvement the least
amount possible,

727
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,180
is to keep those documents in
a safe place,

728
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,780
so you can refer back to them.

729
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,450
So, if nothing else that you
remember do not go to

730
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,540
Vegas on investors money and
spend that money wisely.

731
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,260
>> Okay, so in this section
we're going to talk about just

732
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,940
doing business and, we're
going to hit a couple of

733
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,830
couple of topics in this
section.

734
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,930
So the first one is founder
employment.

735
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,710
Why are we talking about
founder employment?

736
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,970
Because, as we said a couple
times already,

737
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,300
the company is a separate
legal entity.

738
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
It exists completely separate
and apart from U.S.

739
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,260
founders, and so no matter how
prestigious we in

740
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,930
the valley think the title
founder is, you're

741
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,830
really just a company employee
and founders have to be paid.

742
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,240
Working for free is against
the law,

743
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,000
and founders should not let
their company take on

744
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,860
this liability.

745
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,080
You wouldn't work for

746
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,940
free anywhere else, so why is
your startup an exception?

747
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,420
And companies have to pay
payroll taxes.

748
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,690
We had a YC company that
completely blew

749
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,850
off their payroll taxes for
three years, it was a huge,

750
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,110
expensive disaster, and

751
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,480
in extreme cases, people can
actually go to jail for

752
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,320
that, fortunately not in this
case, but it's bad.

753
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,380
So the moral of this story is
setup a payroll service.

754
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,570
This is something that is
worth spending your money on.

755
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,810
But, and I actually I think,
I'm sure some of

756
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,600
the other lecturers have
touched on this points, and

757
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,240
actually Kirsty just mentioned
too.

758
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,840
Don't go overboard on lavish
salaries, minimum wage this is

759
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,780
still a startup and you have
to run lean.

760
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,020
So now I'm going to mention
founder break ups,

761
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,590
and first, well what is a
founder break up?

762
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,410
In this context I'm talking
about one found,

763
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,080
founder on the team being
asked to leave the company.

764
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,130
Which, because I've just said
founders are employees,

765
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,830
that means your cofounders are
firing you.

766
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,410
So why are we talking about
breakups in the context of

767
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:15,180
founder compensation, and it's
because, at YC we have seen

768
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,560
a ton of founder breakups and
we know that the breakups get

769
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,180
extra ugly when the founders
haven't paid themselves.

770
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,350
Why, how does it get ugly?

771
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,220
Unpaid wages become leverage
for

772
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,940
the fired founder to get
something he or she wants from

773
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,800
the company, and typically
that is vesting acceleration.

774
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,160
So the fired founder says,
hey,

775
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,540
my lawyer says you broke the
law by not paying me.

776
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,188
But if you pay me, and

777
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:45,638
you give me some shares that
I'm not actually entitled to,

778
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:49,088
I'll sign a release and make
all this ugliness go away, and

779
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:51,365
if you're the remaining
cofounders,

780
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:54,280
you're probably like, sounds
like a good deal.

781
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,548
And so now you have a
disgruntled person who

782
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:59,383
owns a piece of your company
and even worse in a sense,

783
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,840
the remaining founders are
kind of working for

784
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,360
that ex-founder, right?

785
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,340
Because they're building all
the value in the company and

786
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,100
the ex-founder who got fired
is just sitting there with

787
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,090
their shares going, that's
right, make it valuable.

788
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,770
So, what's the takeaway here?

789
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,410
Avoid problems by paying
yourself, paying your

790
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,660
payroll taxes, and thinking up
of your co-founder's wages

791
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,860
like a marital prenup.

792
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,500
>> And as well as the
founders,

793
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,810
you are going to need to hire
employees.

794
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,060
And again, a lot's been spoken
in previous,

795
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,500
in previous classes here about
how to find those people,

796
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,670
what makes a good fit,

797
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,280
how to make them really
productive employees.

798
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,740
But when you actually find
somebody, how,

799
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,890
how do you hire them?

800
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,969
You know, what's, what's
involved?

801
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,880
And employment is governed by
a huge raft of laws, and

802
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,640
therefore it's important to
get this right.

803
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,850
It's again the kind of
nitty-gritty stuff that as

804
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,440
long as you know the basics
you can probably keep yourself

805
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,150
out of most situations, but as
soon as things get complicated

806
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,750
you need to get yourself
involved with a specialist.

807
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,270
So the first thing you need to
do is figure out if

808
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,180
the employee or

809
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,230
if the person is really an
employee or a contractor, and

810
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,800
there are subtle differences
to this classification.

811
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,070
And this is important to get
right because the IRS

812
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,818
takes a big interest in this
and if they think you've got

813
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:23,110
it wrong they will come after
you and with fines.

814
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:26,512
Both an employee and a
contractor will sign documents

815
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:29,990
that assign any IP that they
create to the company, and

816
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,970
that's obviously really
important.

817
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,000
But the, the form of the
document is very different for

818
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,220
each, each type of person and

819
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,820
the method of payment's very
different.

820
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,620
So generally, a contractor
will be able to set their own

821
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,910
work hours, they'll be able to
set their own location.

822
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,170
They will be given a project
where there is an end result,

823
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,000
but how they actually get to
that and

824
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,010
the means they use will, will
not be set.

825
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,960
They'll be using their own
equipment, and
