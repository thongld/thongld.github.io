1037
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,170
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno
How many of those convert to
my site?

1038
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,980
How many of those then
import?

1039
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,380
To get an idea of your k
factor.

1040
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,970
But the really,

1041
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,300
important thing is still to
think about retention, and

1042
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,570
not to think about virality.

1043
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,670
And only do this after you
have a large

1044
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,620
number of people retained on
your product per person

1045
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,180
who signs up.

1046
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,308
So, couple more things we
were gonna touch on.

1047
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:44,210
SEO, email, SMS and push
notifications.

1048
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,710
So, in SEO,

1049
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,390
there are three things you
need to think about.

1050
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,250
First one is keyword
research.

1051
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,740
People do this badly all the
time.

1052
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,980
So I launched this cocktail
site that I

1053
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,860
talked to you about.

1054
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,730
I spent a year optimizing it
to rank for

1055
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,040
the word cocktail making.

1056
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,650
Turns out in the UK no one
searches for

1057
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,640
cocktail making.

1058
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,660
About 500 people a month.

1059
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,970
I dominated that search
term.

1060
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,490
It was awesome.

1061
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,480
>> I got 400 visitors a
month.

1062
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,780
It was amazing.

1063
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,480
Everyone searches for
cocktail recipes In the UK.

1064
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,110
And in the US, which is the
biggest market,

1065
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,020
everyone searches for drink
recipes.

1066
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,890
So I optimize for the wrong
word.

1067
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,410
So you've gotta do

1068
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,000
your research first about
what you're gonna go after.

1069
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,670
So, research consists of
what do people search for

1070
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,100
that's related to your
sites, how many people

1071
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,940
search for it, how many
other people are ranking for

1072
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,856
it, and how valuable is it
for you.

1073
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:32,260
Supply, demands and value.

1074
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Simple economics I guess.

1075
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,510
So you do your keyword
research.

1076
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,940
You figure out which
keywords you

1077
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,260
want to rank for.

1078
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,410
There are great tools out
there to

1079
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,450
enable you to do that.

1080
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,240
Honestly the best is quite
often the Google AdWords,

1081
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
keyword planner tool.

1082
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,140
Really.

1083
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,380
Once you've done, that

1084
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,260
the next most important
thing is links.

1085
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,550
So, page rank is how all of
SEO is essentially,

1086
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,840
is driven and Google is
based on authority.

1087
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,550
Now there's a lot of other
things in Google's

1088
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,880
algorithm now like do people
search for your website?

1089
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,720
There's a lot stuff about
the distribution of what

1090
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,960
the anchor text is.

1091
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,130
That's send to your site.

1092
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,070
So, if you abuse it and

1093
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,120
spam it they can pop up with
spam.

1094
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,390
White on a white background
five pages below the fold

1095
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,300
doesn't work anymore.

1096
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,470
But, the single most
important thing is to

1097
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,120
get valuable links from

1098
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,980
high authority websites
future ranking Google.

1099
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
Most important thing.

1100
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,050
Then you need to distribute
that log inside your site,

1101
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,550
by internally linking
effectively.

1102
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,670
And when I joined Facebook.

1103
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,596
We'd launched SEO in
September 2007,

1104
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,890
which was before I joined.

1105
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,960
I joined November 2007.

1106
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,510
And we'd launched it, and we
were getting no traffic from

1107
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,470
the pages we'd launched,
public user profiles.

1108
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,680
So, when I went in and
looked at it.

1109
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,100
The only way you could get
to any public user

1110
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,290
profile was to click on the
footer of the page, for

1111
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:49,909
the about link.

1112
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,660
Then click on one of the
blog articles,

1113
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,050
then click on one of the
authors, and then spider out

1114
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,506
through their friends to get
to all their friends.

1115
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:58,530
Turns out that,

1116
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,290
Google was like they buried
these papers,

1117
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,520
they're not very valuable,
and

1118
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,080
we're not going to rank
them.

1119
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,850
We made one change.

1120
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,640
We added a directory so that
Google could quickly get to

1121
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,190
every page on the site.

1122
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,440
And we 100 xd SEO traffic.

1123
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,010
Very, very simple change
drove a lot of

1124
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,940
upside about distributing
the link love internally.

1125
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,200
And then the last thing is
there's a bunch of

1126
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,120
table stakes stuff, HML
sitemaps,

1127
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,850
making sure you have the
right headers, it's all

1128
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,360
covered really well online
for what you wanna do.

1129
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm gonna stop now and make
sure, cuz we have

1130
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,260
a few questions, but, what
other questions are there?

1131
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,650
Go for it.

1132
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,260
>> We're going to email
actually,.

1133
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,500
>> Let's go into email.

1134
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,130
Okay great.

1135
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,340
Email is dead for people
under 25 in my opinion.

1136
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,520
Right?
Young people don't

1137
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,610
use email.

1138
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,600
They use WhatsApp, they use
SMS,

1139
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,690
they use Snapchat, they use
Facebook.

1140
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,750
They don't use email.

1141
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,270
If you're targeting an older
audience, email is,

1142
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,360
pretty successful.

1143
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,070
Email still works for
distribution, but

1144
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,190
realistically, email is not
that great for

1145
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,990
teenagers, especially, and
even people at university.

1146
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,950
You know, how much you use
instant messaging apps and

1147
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,370
how little you use email.

1148
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,100
And you guys are probably,

1149
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,200
on the high end of the scale
for email,

1150
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,119
because you're in Silicon
Valley.

1151
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,290
That being said, on email
the things to think about.

1152
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,750
Email, SMS, and

1153
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,010
push notifications all
behave the same way.

1154
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,980
They all have questions of
deliverability.

1155
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,080
So to finish first, first
you have to finish.

1156
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,640
Your email has to get to
someones inbox.

1157
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,330
So if you send a lot of spam
and

1158
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,180
you end up with dirty IP's,
or you send spam from

1159
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,820
shared servers where other
people are.

1160
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,270
Or if you send email
notifications, from shared

1161
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,060
servers where other people
are sending spam from,

1162
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,030
you are gonna end up being
put in the spam folder

1163
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,150
consistently, and your email
will fail completely.

1164
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,530
You may end up, being
blocked and

1165
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,070
have your email bounce.

1166
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,580
There's a lot of

1167
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,690
stuff around email where you
have to look.

1168
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,000
When you receive feedback
from the servers you

1169
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,510
are sending email too.

1170
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,990
500 series errors versus 400
series errors,

1171
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,180
you have to be respectful of
how those are handled.

1172
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,440
If someone gives you a hard
bounce, retry once or

1173
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,590
twice and, then stop trying.

1174
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,250
Because if you are someone
who abuses people's inboxes,

1175
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,350
the email companies spam
folder you and

1176
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,810
it's very hard to get out.

1177
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,690
If you get caught, on a
Spamhaus link, or

1178
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,340
anything like that, it's
very hard to get out.

1179
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,190
It's really important with
email,

1180
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,470
that you are a high-class
citizen,

1181
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,300
that you do good work with
email because you want to

1182
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,420
have deliverability for the
long run.

1183
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,910
That counts for push
notifications and SMS2.

1184
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,390
With SMS, you can go and buy
SMS traffic, via gray routes

1185
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,250
with people with their
having phones strung up.

1186
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,730
Attached to a like computer
and pumping out SMS's.

1187
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,520
That works for a time but it
always get shut down.

1188
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,200
And I've seen so

1189
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,100
many companies make these
mistakes.

1190
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,270
Where they think they're
gonna grow

1191
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,960
by using these kind of
tactics.

1192
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,840
If you can't get your email,
your SMS or

1193
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,120
your push delivered.

1194
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,830
You will never get any
success from these.

1195
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,950
Push, you spam your power
users, I know

1196
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,250
that's slightly different to
what I said earlier.

1197
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,160
But you actually, spam your
power users and

1198
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,100
give them notifications that
they don't care about and

1199
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,600
make it really hard for them
to opt out.

1200
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,160
So, there's no settings
where they can opt out,

1201
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,830
and they start blocking you.

1202
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,960
You can never push them
once,

1203
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,520
they've opted out of your
push notifications.

1204
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,690
And it's very hard actually,
to prompt them to

1205
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,860
turn them on once they've
turned them off.

1206
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,340
So, number one thing to
think about about email,

1207
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,020
SMS, and

1208
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,100
push notification is you
have to get them delivered.

1209
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,660
Beyond that,

1210
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,510
it's a question of open
rate, click through rate.

1211
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,470
So, what is the compelling
subject line you

1212
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,360
can put there.

1213
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,430
So, that people are gonna
open your email.

1214
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,050
And how can you get them to
click when they visit?

1215
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
Everyone focuses towards
doing,

1216
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,850
marketing email that are
just spam.

1217
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,300
In my opinion Newsletters
are stupid.

1218
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,180
Don't do newsletters,
because you'll

1219
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,250
send the same message to
everyone on your site.

1220
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,960
Someone, who signed up

1221
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,760
to your site yesterday
versus someone,

1222
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,860
who's been using your
product for three years.

1223
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,980
Do they need the same
message?

1224
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,070
No.

1225
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,930
The most effective email you
can do is notifications.

1226
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,840
So, what are you sending?

1227
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,540
What should you be notifying
people of?

1228
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,300
And this is a great place
where we're in

1229
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,590
the wrong mindset.

1230
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,270
As a Facebook user I don't
want Facebook to email me

1231
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,910
about every like I receive,
because I receive a lot of

1232
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,430
likes cuz I've got a bunch
of Facebook friends.

1233
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,120
But as a new Facebook user,

1234
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,190
that first like you receive
is a magic moment.

1235
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,010
Turning on that notification
across all of

1236
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,500
of our channels, increased
the click through rate

1237
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
on our email, SMS and
push-notifications.

1238
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,620
But we only turned it on,
for low-engaged users who

1239
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,820
weren't coming back to the
site so

1240
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,170
it wouldn't be spamming
them.

1241
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,120
So, it was a great
experience.

1242
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,730
To think about that.

1243
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,890
What notifications should we
be sending

1244
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,050
is the first thing you need
to think about on email,

1245
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,170
SMS, and push.

1246
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,790
And then the second thing
you need to

1247
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,900
be thinking about is.

1248
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,180
How can you create great

1249
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,620
triggered marketing
campaigns?

1250
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,570
So, when someone creates
their first,

1251
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,280
cross border trade
transaction was one of

1252
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,240
the best email campaigns, I
was ever part of at eBay in

1253
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,170
terms of click-through
rates.

1254
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,180
It was awesome.

1255
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,590
Because it was really
timely,

1256
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,260
really in context the right
thing to do for the user.

1257
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,440
So I'd say, make sure you
have deliverability.

1258
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,880
Most important thing.

1259
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,690
Focus on notifications and
trigger based email,

1260
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,220
SMS, and push notifications
beyond that.

1261
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,760
So, I think we're out of
time.

1262
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,679
There's one thing I wanted
to finish with which is.

1263
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,180
And if you guys have any
questions, I guess, like,

1264
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:07,810
you can reach me and

1265
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,120
if I get spammed, I just
won't reply.

1266
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:12,360
We have great spam filters,

1267
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,740
no, my only favorite quotes
is from General Patton,

1268
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,940
and it's so cliche it's
crazy but it's awesome.

1269
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,260
A good plan, violently
executed today is

1270
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,600
better than a perfect plan
tomorrow and

1271
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,330
one of the things the most
instilled in us.

1272
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,030
And Harvey still instills in
us and Mark instills across

1273
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,780
the whole of Facebook is
this move fast and

1274
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,430
don't be afraid to break
stuff ethos.

1275
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,120
If you can run more
experiments than

1276
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,500
the next guy, if you can be
hungry for growth.

1277
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,680
If you fight and die for
every extra user.

1278
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,120
And you stay up late at
night to get those extra

1279
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,570
users to run those
experiments to

1280
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,270
get the data and do it over
and over and over again.

1281
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,880
You will grow faster.

1282
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,260
Marcus said he thinks we won
'cause we wanted it more,

1283
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,990
and I really believe that.

1284
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,210
We just worked really hard.

1285
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,770
It's not like we're crazy
smart, or

1286
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,300
we've all done these crazy
things before.

1287
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,830
We just worked really,
really hard,

1288
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,110
and we executed fast.

1289
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,700
And I strongly encourage you
to do that.

1290
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,538
Growth is optional.

1291
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:14,900
Thank you.
