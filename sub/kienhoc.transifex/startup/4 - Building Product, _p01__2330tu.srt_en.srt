00:00:04,773 --> 00:00:06,318

>> Thanks for having me.

2
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,993
So today I am going to be
talking about how to go

3
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:14,740
from zero users to many
users.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,760
I'm just assuming that you
have many great ideas in

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,376
your head at this moment and

6
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:22,550
you're kind of thinking
about what the next step is.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,620
So I wrote this up early
this morning,

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,880
and a lot of this is based
off of mistakes I've

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,170
made in the past.

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,370
So as Sam mentioned, I went
through YC in 2010 and

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,740
spent a number, three years
basically, going back and

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,290
forth pivoting a bunch of
times,

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,200
starting over a bunch of
times.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,560
And have learned a lot about
what not to do if I

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,340
were to start another
startup after Homejoy if

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,690
that should ever happen.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,994
And so a lot of it comes
from failure and

18
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:56,379
just telling you about what
you shouldn't do and kind of

19
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:59,117
making generalizations of
what you should do

20
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,852
from that.

21
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,788
So just a reminder that this
is,

22
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:04,728
sort of, you know, all
advice you should take as

23
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,456
directionally good guidance,
like if all,

24
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,569
like it's, it's kind of in
the right direction.

25
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,541
But every business is
different,

26
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,853
you are different, I'm not
you, and so

27
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,920
just take everything with,
you know, that in mind.

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,060
So since this is a college
course, you know,

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,670
when you start a startup you
should basically have lots

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,120
of time on your hands to
concentrate on the start up.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,639
And I'm not saying you
should you know,

32
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,031
quit school or you should
quit work.

33
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:35,485
What I'm saying is you
should have a lot of time,

34
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,346
compressed time in a row.

35
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,258
Really dedicated to
immersing yourself in

36
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:41,487
the idea and developing
problems, or developing

37
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,860
the solutions to the problem
you're trying to solve.

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,910
So for example if you're in
school, you know,

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,980
it's better to have one or

40
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,520
two days straight of per
week on working on your idea

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,640
versus you know, spending
two hours here and there

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,250
every single day during the
course of the week.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,410
It's sort of like, I think
this is an engineering class

44
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,269
so it's sort of like coding.

45
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,050
Like there's a lot of
context switching and

46
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,920
just being able to really
focus, really, really focus

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,390
and immerse yourself is very
very important.

48
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,460
So, like I said, I sort of
first,

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,720
when I wrote this up was
thinking what

50
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,520
are things that some people
do or most people do that is

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,070
not the correct way to do a
startup and sort of

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,560
the novice approach I think
is what you see up here.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,630
Which is, you know, I have
this really great idea.

54
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,500
I don't wanna tell anyone
about it.

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,986
I'm gonna build, build,
build, build.

56
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:37,470
I'm gonna be telling one or

57
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,100
two people and then I'm
gonna launch it on,

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,710
you know, I'm gonna launch
it on TechCrunch or some,

59
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,760
somewhere like that, then
I'm gonna get lots of users.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,520
But what really happens is
because you did not

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,640
get a lot of that feedback
and stuff like that,

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,260
you know maybe you get a lot
of people to your site,

63
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,560
but no one sticks around
because you didn't get

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,110
that initial user feedback.

65
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,230
And then, you know, if you,

66
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,670
you know, if lucky enough
you have some money in

67
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,490
the bank you might go buy
some users but sort of,

68
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,780
it just whittles out over
time and you just give up.

69
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,503
This is sort of a vicious
cycle and

70
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,596
you know, I actually did
this once, and

71
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:11,011
I did this while I was in
YC,

72
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:13,595
and that was you know like,
when I went through YC I

73
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,257
didn't even launch a
product,

74
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:18,150
like I didn't even launch in
TechCrunch which is a thing

75
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,600
you should definitely do.

76
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,950
And so you don't want to
ever get into that

77
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,780
cycle because you'll just
end up with nothing good.

78
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,120
So, the next thing is you
know, you have an idea and

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,080
you should really think
about what the idea

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,060
is really solving.

81
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,720
Like what is the actual
problem?

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
And so their problem
statements you should be

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
able to describe it in one
sentence.

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,610
And then you should think,

85
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,200
how does that problem relate
to me?

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,420
Am I really passionate about
that problem?

87
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,720
And then you should think,
okay, it's a problem I have,

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,420
is it a problem that other
people have?

89
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,805
And sort of verify that by,
you know, just going out and

90
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:58,040
talking to people.

91
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,674
One of the biggest mistakes
I've made is you know,

92
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,210
we started, my co-founder
and I,

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,322
who is also my brother, he
and

94
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:10,653
I started a company called
Pathjoy in 2009, 2010.

95
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,360
And our goal was basically
to you know,

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,971
we had two goals in mind one
is to create a company that

97
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:20,584
made people really happy,
and create a company that

98
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:23,784
was very, very impactful, so
a good proxy for

99
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:26,847
that is to just create a
huge, big company.

100
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:28,589
And so we thought, okay,

101
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,075
here's sort of what we're
gonna solve is you know,

102
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,720
make people happier, and we
first went to the notion of

103
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,590
who are the people that made
people happy?

104
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,438
And you know,

105
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:42,500
we came up with life coaches
and therapists.

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,790
So it seemed kind of obvious
to

107
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,920
just create a platform for
life coaches and therapists.

108
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,380
And what happened as a
result though was that you

109
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,180
know, when we started using
the product ourselves we,

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,560
you know, we're not cynical
people by any means,

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,450
but life coaches and
therapists are just not

112
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,890
people we would use
ourselves.

113
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,790
It was sort of useless to
us.

114
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,470
And so, it wasn't even a
problem we had, and

115
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,420
certainly wasn't something
we

116
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,360
were super passionate about
building out.

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
Yet we spent, you know,

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,470
almost a year trying to do
this.

119
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,670
And so, if you just start,
you know,

120
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,470
from tegel zero, just like
think about this before you

121
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,760
even build any product.

122
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,300
I think you can save
yourself a lot of

123
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,210
headache down the road

124
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,167
from doing something you
don't wanna do.

125
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,510
So, say you have a problem
and you're able to state it.

126
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,520
Where do you start?

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,609
Like, how do you think of
solutions?

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,957
So the first thing you
should do is think of

129
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:40,920
what the industry that you
are getting yourself into.

130
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,070
Whether it's big, whether
it's huge,

131
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,470
you should really immerse
yourself in that industry.

132
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,710
There's a number of ways to
do this.

133
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,790
One is, you know, to really
become a cog in

134
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,910
that industry for a little
bit.

135
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,000
And so it might seem a
little counter-intuitive to

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,270
do this, because most people
say, you know,

137
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,330
if you really wanna disrupt
an industry, you

138
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,330
should really not be this,
you know, player in it.

139
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,280
You should, you know,
someone who spent 20 or

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,770
30 years in an industry
probably you know, is set in

141
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,990
their ways and is just used
to the way things work and

142
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,090
really can't think about
what the inefficiencies are

143
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,220
or the things that you can,
quote, unquote, disrupt.

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,060
But, however as a noob like
coming into the industry,

145
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,350
you really should take one
or

146
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,170
two months just really
understanding what all

147
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,880
the little bits and pieces
of the industry are, and how

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,790
it works because it's when
you get into the details,

149
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,270
that's when you start seeing
things you can exploit.

150
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,710
Things you can really,
things that are really,

151
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,450
really inefficient and
provide you know huge

152
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,590
overhead costs that you can
cut down.

153
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,740
And, so an example of this
is, you know,

154
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,560
when we start Homejoy and
we, we decided to go,

155
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,670
we started with the cleaning
industry and when we

156
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,180
started, you know, we just
were cleaners ourselves.

157
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,800
And we started to clean
houses and

158
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,970
we found out really quickly
was that

159
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,450
we were very bad cleaners.

160
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,380
And so as a result, you
know, we said, okay, we

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,298
got to learn more about this
and we went to buy books.

162
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:12,790
And we bought books about
how to clean,

163
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,320
which helped maybe a little
bit,

164
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,180
we learned a little bit more
about cleaning supplies.

165
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,520
But it's sort of like
basketball you know,

166
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,220
you can watch and you can
learn,

167
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,740
or you can watch and you can
read about basketball, but

168
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,830
you're not gonna get any
better at

169
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,510
it if you don't actually you
know, train and you know,

170
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,826
throw a basketball around
and throw it into the hoop.

171
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,740
And so we decided one of us
basically had to go and

172
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,570
learn how to clean.

173
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,395
And so we went or

174
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,314
get trained by you know, a
professional, some sort of

175
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:43,578
a professional training
programs that existed.

176
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:46,230
And that meant, we actually
went to get a job at

177
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,319
a cleaning company itself.

178
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,680
And the cool thing was that
you know, I learned how to

179
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,460
clean from you know,
training for the few weeks

180
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,690
that I was there at the
cleaning company.

181
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,113
But the even better thing
was that I learned a lot

182
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,289
about how a local cleaning
company worked.

183
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,489
And in that sense you know,
I learned why a local

184
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:11,170
cleaning company could not
become huge like Homejoy is

185
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,450
today and that's because
they have, you know,

186
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,531
they're pretty old school
and

187
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:19,892
they have a lot of things,
just from anywhere from

188
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:23,094
booking the customer to
optimizing the cleaner

189
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:26,245
schedules was just done very
inefficiently.

190
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:30,737
And so there is, so, if you
are in a situation like mine

191
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:34,937
where you know, there's a
service element to it,

192
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:38,900
you should go and do that
service yourself.

193
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,510
You know, if your thing is
related to restaurants you

194
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,640
should become a waiter it's
really to you know,

195
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,790
if it's painting you know
become a painter kind of

196
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,960
get in the shoes of your
customers from all angles of

197
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,850
what you're trying to build.

198
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,910
The other thing is there's
also levels of obsessiveness

199
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,340
that you should have with it
too as well.

200
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,900
You should be so obsessed to
know what everybody in

201
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,190
the space is doing.

202
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,290
And it's things like, you
know,

203
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,660
running a list of all the
potential competitors or

204
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,990
similar types of companies,
Google searching it, and

205
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,290
clicking on every single
link and

206
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,860
reading every single article
from like,

207
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,660
search result 1 to 1,000.

208
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,950
You know, I found all
potential competitors,

209
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,590
big and small, and

210
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,610
if they're public, I would
go read their S1's,

211
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,570
I would go read all their
quarterly financials,

212
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,000
I would, you know, sit on
the earnings calls.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,730
There's, you know, most of
these you don't get much out

214
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,390
of it, but there's just
these golden nuggets that

215
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,440
you'll find once in a while
and you can't,

216
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,600
you won't be able to find
that unless you

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,290
actually go through the work
of,

218
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,870
you know, getting all that
information in your head.

219
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,000
So yeah, you should become
an expert in the industry.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,120
There should be no doubt
when you're building this

221
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,550
that you are the expert so
that people will trust you

222
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,680
when you're building this
product.

223
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,500
The second thing is

224
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,340
identifying customer
segments.

225
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,610
So you know, ideally at the
end of the day,

226
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,670
in the end game, you built a
product or

227
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,434
a business that everybody in
the world is using.

228
00:10:05,434 --> 00:10:07,910
But realistically in the
beginning you kind of

229
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,160
want to corner off a certain
part of the customer base so

230
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,321
that you can really optimize
for them, and that's just

231
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,860
you know, it's just about a
matter of focus and a matter

232
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,860
of you know, just catering
towards whether it's

233
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,205
teenage girls or whether
it's you know, soccer moms.

234
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,150
You would just be able to
you know,

235
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,609
like I said focus a lot on
their needs.

236
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,640
And, lastly before before
you even create the product,

237
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,230
before you put code down,
you should really storyboard

238
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,490
out the ideal user
experience of how you're,

239
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,800
how you're gonna solve the
problem.

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,820
And that, and that's not
just meaning, you know,

241
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,310
the web site itself, it's
meaning, you know,

242
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,210
how does the customer find
out about you.

243
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,910
You know, whether it's, you
know,

244
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,620
it could be through an ad or
through word of mouth or

245
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,590
whatever, so they find out
about you.

246
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,760
They come to your site, they
learn more about you, what's

247
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,670
all that text say, what are
you communicating to them.

248
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,340
So the actual, when they
sign up for the product or

249
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,790
they purchase the service,

250
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,430
what are they actually
getting,

251
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,420
to after they finish using
the product or

252
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,800
after they finish using the
service.

253
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,100
What's you know, there's
sort of

254
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,525
like an evaluation period,
like they leave a review, or

255
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:21,660
they leave comments or
whatnot, and just being able

256
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,720
to go through that whole
flow and visualize in your

257
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,628
head, like just envision
what the perfect user

258
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:32,370
experience is and then put
it down on paper and

259
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,008
then put it into code, and
then start from there.

260
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:40,530
So you have all these ideas
in your head now,

261
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,320
you kind of know what the
core customer base you

262
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,210
want to go after is.

263
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,354
And you know like everything
about the industry,

264
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:48,810
what do you do next?

265
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,650
So you start building your
products.

266
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,160
And you know, the common
phrase that most people

267
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,652
use these days is you should
build a minimum viable,

268
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,250
the MVP, minimum viable
product.

269
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,500
And I know I'm viable
because I

270
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,950
think a lot of people skip
that part,

271
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,200
and they just go out with a
feature and then the whole

272
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,121
user experience in the very
beginning like is flat.

273
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:13,190
So the minimum viable
product pretty much

274
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,189
means you know,

275
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:18,340
what is the smallest feature
set that you should build

276
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,370
to solve the problem that
you're trying to solve.

277
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,818
And I think if you go
through the whole storyboard

278
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:27,549
experience, you can kind of
figure that very quickly.

279
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,050
But again you have to be
talking to users right,

280
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,724
potential users, you have to
be

281
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,266
seeing what exists out there
already and what you

282
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:38,025
should be building to solve
their immediate needs.

283
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:42,305
And the second thing is,
before you put
