1057
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,320
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHAh6WKBgiE
but really getting consumers
to

1058
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,880
download apps is obviously
very difficult.

1059
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,500
Yeah.
I don't, I don't.

1060
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,190
In.
I don't usually

1061
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,010
just download apps.

1062
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,952
Yeah.
To send a message.

1063
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:31,492
[CROSS-TALK].

1064
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:33,860
In, in most businesses we have
a called action,

1065
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,461
which says text the owner
directly.

1066
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:36,000
Oh.

1067
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,110
We've tested actually a bunch
of

1068
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,330
copy that works the best in
small print.

1069
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,950
We have, the messages are
anonymous,

1070
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,580
they also lowers the barrier
to entry.

1071
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,250
I think the most
counterintuitive thing we've

1072
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,910
learned in the kind of launch
that we've had where,

1073
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,730
in 350 locations in the Bay,
we've been doing this for

1074
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,290
about three months we're about
11%

1075
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,710
weekly growth rate in terms of
acquiring businesses.

1076
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,420
But the most counter-intuitive
thing that we learned,

1077
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,450
because we weren't actually
sure,

1078
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,480
is, will people send messages
when they walk

1079
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,660
into [CROSS-TALK] and they do.

1080
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,800
What's the number one type of
message that people send?

1081
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,806
So you would, so originally,

1082
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:05,586
we started this product off
thinking this is going to be,

1083
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:06,960
like, in-location feedback.

1084
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,060
That was the premise,
in-location feedback.

1085
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,205
What we found is more than
half the messages,

1086
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:12,510
are actually not about
feedback at all,

1087
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,822
they ask things like we,

1088
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:16,750
we were in this location in
San Jose this Kabob stand,

1089
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,300
father and son, it's just a
take out place, and

1090
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,270
we saw messages that go
through,

1091
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,580
that went through that said
like are you hiring?

1092
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,110
And that's like very strange
because you

1093
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,690
would think like why wouldn't
you just ask the owner.

1094
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,940
Yeah.
But we realized that we know

1095
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,930
this is the owner, and

1096
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,490
the person who's walking in
doesn't and so

1097
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,970
they, they do prefer to
actually just text the owner

1098
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,310
because they think that's a,
that's an easier medium.

1099
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,559
Okay, so it's like a
suggestion box, or

1100
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,355
it's like a way to just like
message a business.

1101
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:39,549
Yeah, initially that's what we
thought it was, but

1102
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,695
what we actually discovered
was the vast majority,

1103
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:43,450
I shouldn't say vast majority,
over half

1104
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,937
the messages are actually just
things like when do you open,

1105
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,100
when do you close because
that's not on Google.

1106
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,800
Do you, do, you know, are you
catering can you,

1107
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,370
do you have any reservations
available tonight, et cetera.

1108
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,260
Okay, okay.
Well, look,

1109
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,080
in terms of your traction it

1110
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,500
sounds like you said you had
some businesses, like.

1111
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,310
Yeah.
Tell me about what,

1112
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,410
what you guys have right now.

1113
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,350
So we have about 350
businesses,

1114
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,930
all from San Jose to San
Francisco.

1115
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,760
We sold them ourselves as
three founders.

1116
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,030
We're all technical, but we
actually did all the sales

1117
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,240
because we learned a lot about
how these businesses work.

1118
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,740
We actually come from a retail
background.

1119
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,212
We originally built this
product for

1120
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,452
large enterprise players like
Starbucks and Walmart.

1121
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:15,608
But we recognize that closing
those contracts, and

1122
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:18,111
our limited amount of runway
wouldn't really be possible.

1123
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,876
So we wanted to get the
product in the hands of users.

1124
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:20,991
So we did SMBs.

1125
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,340
And that's when we discovered
hey,

1126
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,741
this like, this messaging
product.

1127
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,000
>> Okay, okay, that sounds
interesting.

1128
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,540
It sounds like you have some
customers.

1129
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,120
>> Yes, so we get.
>> How, how

1130
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,000
could this be big though?

1131
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like, okay, maybe you can
100,000 customers.

1132
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,450
>> Yeah, so, in terms of like,
numbers, we, we see one and

1133
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,770
half messages on average per
location per day.

1134
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,170
That might not sound a lot,
but

1135
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,620
for a business, that's
skidding 30 messages.

1136
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,800
You take like a Yelp review or
a Google review.

1137
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,720
In a lifetime of visits, they
might get five or seven.

1138
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,050
So they're getting a, a huge
volume of messages relative to

1139
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,340
what they tend to experience
and they're private, so

1140
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,280
they're not public.

1141
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,850
So in terms of, how do we
actually make money, it's not,

1142
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,140
you know, frankly speaking,

1143
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,990
we don't have a very clear
answer there.

1144
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,970
The two paths are the SMB side
or

1145
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,950
the LCS side, the large
customer side.

1146
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,940
Large customers, we know from
our retail experience,

1147
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,900
just regular feedback tools
are 3 to 4 million per year,

1148
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,016
so a like a Sear's, where we
came from.

1149
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:12,810
SMBs we've tested with are
willing to pay $50 a month,

1150
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,900
so, I, I, you know, I
certainly I think this is.

1151
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,670
>> Okay.
>> This can be a large

1152
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,050
business, but, and there's
clear ways to make money, but.

1153
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,570
I could see, I could see that.

1154
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,540
Just a couple things like,

1155
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,610
can you tell me about your
distribution strategy and

1156
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,830
also just a little bit about
the team.

1157
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,590
>> Yeah.
So

1158
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,770
distribution so the thing that
we learned in

1159
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,490
selling to these SMBs is it's
really freaking hard.

1160
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,710
there, the formula LTV minus
CPA, lifetime value minus cost

1161
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,740
price acquisition in SMB is
never going to work out.

1162
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,270
Right.
>> And so we

1163
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,150
have two solutions.

1164
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,250
One is to go up market,

1165
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,490
like we originally planned,
the Starbucks or

1166
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:44,250
Walmarts or two is actually
essentially pair with

1167
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,380
consumer facing companies
Yelp, Google, Facebook.

1168
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,200
>> Have you been talking to
them,

1169
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:47,960
do they actually want to do
it?

1170
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,080
>> Yeah, so we've talked to
Google and

1171
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,600
Facebook we're meeting with
Yelp.

1172
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,990
What we're basically want to
do is every time you

1173
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,480
search for a business there
should be a message button.

1174
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,600
We want to get consumers in
the habit of knowing,

1175
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,610
they can send, essentially a
text message to any business.

1176
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,800
That can help us get broad
distribution.

1177
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,442
Our real vision is to become
kind of that infrastructure,

1178
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,500
that messaging infrastructure
between consumers and

1179
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,030
business.

1180
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,880
If that doesn't work, let's
say Google, Facebook, and

1181
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,440
Yelp don't want to give up
that valuable property.

1182
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,820
It's really an ad unit.

1183
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,670
>> Okay.

1184
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,110
>> we, we do want to sell this
as a feedback tool to large,

1185
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:17,710
large players.

1186
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,353
>> All right.
Can you tell me

1187
00:44:18,353 --> 00:44:19,070
a little about the team?

1188
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,080
We're running low on, on time.

1189
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,430
>> Yeah, there's three of us.

1190
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,970
All technical.

1191
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,740
We Mike and I did a company
before.

1192
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,400
Sunny is an ex-Google
engineer.

1193
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,910
We come from retail.

1194
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,490
So and our first startup was a
failure.

1195
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,880
So, I don't know if that's
good or

1196
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,440
bad but, we've, we've worked
together and, yeah.

1197
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,190
We're all technical, we built
everything ourselves.

1198
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,380
And we sold everything
ourselves.

1199
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,730
>> Okay.
>> So we've already had

1200
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:41,360
a couple conversations with
your firm.

1201
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,769
We're raising 500,000 and 8.5
million convertible note.

1202
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,820
Of that 500, 250's committed
by Mike Mapels,

1203
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,800
Eli Gill, and Aiden Sinkit.

1204
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,850
And Mike with Floodgate is
willing to fill the round.

1205
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,790
We think your, you know,

1206
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,680
you particularly, you and your
firm can bring a lot to

1207
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,090
the team with your retail
experience.

1208
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,150
Is this something that's
interesting to you?

1209
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,950
>> Yeah, you know, I, I think
this is really interesting.

1210
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,590
I mean, I would need to talk
to a couple more folks on my

1211
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,420
side, but I do think this
this,

1212
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,520
this could be pretty big.

1213
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,160
>> Yes, since we've had a
couple conversations before

1214
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,380
and and we're certainly
willing to meet again,

1215
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,880
we are closing a round this
Friday.

1216
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,740
And so, certainly take time
and let, you know, and

1217
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,730
let, your other partners know.

1218
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,200
I'll be available between now
and Friday.

1219
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,420
I'll give you another call
before Friday.

1220
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,000
Before we close the round.

1221
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,880
But we'd love to actually see
you, see you in the round.

1222
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,540
>> Okay.
Well sounds good.

1223
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,360
I gotta go, but thanks for
talking to me.

1224
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,630
>> Great.
Thanks.

1225
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,560
Okay.

1226
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,230
All right,.
>> So

1227
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,780
very different class type of,
type of a conversation.

1228
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,900
>> Yeah, so do you have a
clicker.

1229
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,950
>> Yes.
>> So in terms of that one,

1230
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,720
you know, some key points here
is, try to

1231
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,190
actually tell a narrative that
makes sense to people.

1232
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,230
You notice there was
narratives there.

1233
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,070
He was talking about people,
how they really use it.

1234
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,880
Were able to tie it down to
the real world, which is good.

1235
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,700
He was able to demonstrate
insights, and

1236
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,300
actually tell me something I
didn't already know about

1237
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,850
the market, like, there were,
there were some tidbits there.

1238
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:04,590
It was more, it was more of a
collaborative meeting where it

1239
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,440
felt more like a conversation
than just like a,

1240
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,350
like I was interviewing him
about something in,

1241
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:09,990
in my opinion.

1242
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,030
He actually asked for money.

1243
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,360
And this is the other key
thing is at the end,

1244
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,450
you saw I could have easily
just been like,

1245
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,550
okay, gotta go.

1246
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,020
But he, he did talk about
fundraising as,

1247
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,930
as Michael mentioned.

1248
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:23,030
And he was able to provide all
the context and

1249
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,250
all the questions I would need

1250
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,200
to actually have a serious
conversation with him.

1251
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,550
If he was cagey about it or
shy about it,

1252
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,090
and not clear on the numbers,
that there's a very high,

1253
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,010
good chance that, you know, I
probably would have just ended

1254
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,450
the conversation, due to time
pressure.

1255
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,240
>> Yeah, it's interesting.

1256
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,600
And we, we sit on this side a
lot.

1257
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,580
You really, you can tell when
people are very passionate and

1258
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,060
know their business very, very
well.

1259
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,980
And that's what you have to
become.

1260
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,200
okay.
So closing thoughts here

1261
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,710
before we, what you want to do
after the meeting.

1262
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,910
Before we get into the Q&A.

1263
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,590
We're running a little short
on time.

1264
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,540
After the meeting, the first
thing,

1265
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,000
just like Tyler said in the
sales thing, follow up.

1266
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,540
This is, this is important.

1267
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,190
And anything other than a
check, or wired funds is a no.

1268
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,260
So if they say, we gotta keep
talking to partners,

1269
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,970
I assume that's a no.

1270
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,804
And so, you do want to put
some pressure.

1271
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:10,540
The way that you can do that
is get deal heat.

1272
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,310
Deal heat is just a term which
means there's a demand for

1273
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,560
your, to, to be in your round.

1274
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,550
This is the easiest way and

1275
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,600
an important way to actually
drive up price, et cetera.

1276
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:21,440
Due diligence on the
investors.

1277
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,820
So let's say you have that
500,000 raise for your

1278
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,908
seed round on the 8.5 million
like we used in this example.

1279
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:28,370
Due diligence investors.

1280
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,740
If you do find it, I, I do,
due diligence on adults, and

1281
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,990
I find, hey, he's actually not
a great investor.

1282
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,030
I can get Elaud, or Mike
Maples, or

1283
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,810
whoever to actually fill the
rest of the round.

1284
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,640
It's surprising to us,

1285
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,700
how many entrepreneurs don't
do this.

1286
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,520
You would, it's like,

1287
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,080
you would actually spend a lot
of time hiring somebody.

1288
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,500
You're selling a part of your
company to somebody,

1289
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,470
you should know who you're
selling it to.

1290
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,240
To make sure they,

1291
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,980
you know, they're the type of
people you think they are.

1292
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,810
And then last, know when to
stop.

1293
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,910
So some founders get so good
at fundraising they just

1294
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,160
want to do it all the time
because it's much easier to

1295
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,540
do than actually building the
company.

1296
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,830
>> Yeah, you think you can

1297
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,954
fundraising does not equal
success and just because.

1298
00:48:03,954 --> 00:48:04,970
>> Yeah.
>> You fund-raise does not

1299
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,300
mean you succeeded and nobody
realizes that and

1300
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,970
I'm, we say this and we'll say
this now, but

1301
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,320
I'm sure everyone will still
equate fundraising with

1302
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,250
success and read about
someone's fundraising and

1303
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,730
assume that means they're
successful.

1304
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,900
>> Well my, my, my intuition
as to why this is

1305
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,910
the case is because a lot of
smart people their whole life,

1306
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,490
they've like, applied to good
schools and applied to

1307
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,530
good jobs, and they, they just
think fundraising is

1308
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,050
another like application they
can just kind of check off.

1309
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,610
And building a company is much
more ambiguous, but.

1310
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,550
Anyways, that's, that's the
session.

1311
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,490
I don't if we have time for,
oh.

1312
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,110
The edge is under,

1313
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,740
underlining, building your
company.

1314
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,620
Fundraising is not the goal.

1315
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,980
>> Can you guys just stick
around for

1316
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,670
a few minutes after, and
answer questions?

1317
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,440
>> Sure.
>> Yeah, we can do that.

1318
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,330
>> All right.
Thank you very much,

1319
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,433
that was great.
