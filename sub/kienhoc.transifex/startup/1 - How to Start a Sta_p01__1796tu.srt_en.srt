Welcome.

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:04,217
Can I turn this on?

3
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:07,381
Maybe, all right.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,090
>> Can people hear in the
back?

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,660
>> Can you guys hear me?

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,678
Is the mic on?

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:18,038
No, ah, maybe you can ask
them to turn it on.

8
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:19,490
Maybe we can get a bigger,
ah, there we go.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,657
All right.

10
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,618
Maybe we can get a bigger
auditorium, we'll see.

11
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:25,270
So welcome to CS183B.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,950
I'm Sam Altman.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm the President of Y
Combinator.

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,780
Nine years ago, I was a
Stanford student and

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,630
then I dropped out to start
a company.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,990
And then I've been an
investor for the last few.

17
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,140
So, at YC, we've been
teaching people how to

18
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,440
start startups for nine
years.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,930
Most of it's very hands on
and

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,875
specific to the startups.

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,180
But, 30% of it is pretty
generally applicable.

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,340
And so, we think that we

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,210
can teach that 30% in this
class.

24
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,890
And even though that's only
30% of the way

25
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,600
there hopefully it'll still
be really helpful.

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,750
We've taught a lot of this
at YC already, but

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,520
it's all been off the
record.

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
And this is the first time
that a lot of what we

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,370
teach in YC is gonna be on
the record.

30
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,360
So we've invited some of our
best speakers to come and

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,809
give the same talks they
give at YC.

32
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,960
We've now funded 720
companies.

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,620
And so, we're pretty sure

34
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,460
that a lot of this advice is
pretty good.

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,000
We can't fund every startup
yet, but we can

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,710
hopefully make this advice
very generally available.

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,300
Guest speakers are gonna
teach 17 of the 20 classes.

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,010
I'm only teaching three.

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
Counting YC itself,

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,820
every guest speaker has been
involved in the creation of

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,840
a billion plus dollar
company.

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,110
So the advice shouldn't be
that theoretical.

43
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,680
It's all been, it's all from
people who have done it.

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,270
All of the advice in

45
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,340
this class is geared towards
people starting a business

46
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,360
where the goal was
hyper-growth.

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,700
And eventually building a
very large company.

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,360
Much of it doesn't apply in
other cases and

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,950
I wanna warn people up
front.

50
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,610
That if you try and

51
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,730
do these things in a lot of
big companies or

52
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,640
non startups, it won't work.

53
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,130
It should still be
interesting.

54
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,720
I, I really do think that
startups are the way of

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,060
the future and it's worth
trying to understand them.

56
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,470
But startups are very
different

57
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,300
than normal companies.

58
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,040
So over the course of today
and

59
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,660
Thursday, I'm gonna try to
give an overview of the four

60
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,580
areas that you need to excel
at in order to

61
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,930
maximize your chances of
success at a startup.

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,490
And then throughout the
course, the guest speakers

63
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,750
are gonna drill into all of
these in more detail.

64
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,480
So the four areas, you need
a great idea,

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,660
a great product, a great
team and great execution.

66
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,650
These overlap somewhat, but
I'm gonna have to talk about

67
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,130
them somewhat individually
to make it make sense.

68
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,600
You may still fail.

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,230
The outcome is something
like idea times product

70
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,300
times execution times team
times luck,

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,010
where luck is the random
number between 0 and 10,000.

72
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,300
Literally that much.

73
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,500
But if you do really well in
the four areas you can

74
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,205
control, you have a good
chance of at

75
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:40,637
least some amount of
success.

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,771
One of the exciting things
about startups, is

77
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,590
that they are surprisingly
even playing field.

78
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,290
Young and inexperienced, you
can do this.

79
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,500
Old and very experienced,
you can do this too.

80
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,885
And one of the things that I
particularly like about

81
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:55,700
startups is that some of the
things that are bad in

82
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,720
other work situations, like
being poor and unknown are

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,875
actually huge assets when it
comes to starting a startup.

84
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,340
Before we jump in on the
how.

85
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,850
I want to talk about why you
should start a startup.

86
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm somewhat hesitant to be
doing this class at all,

87
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,110
because you should never
start a startup just for

88
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,520
the sake of doing so.

89
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,530
There are much easier ways
to get rich and

90
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,220
everyone who starts a
startup always says,

91
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,610
always, that they couldn't
have imagined how hard and

92
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,360
painful it was going to be.

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,330
You should only start a
startup if you com,

94
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,860
feel compelled by a
particular problem.

95
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,410
And that you think starting
a company is

96
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,120
the best way to solve it.

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,090
The specific passion should
come first and

98
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,510
the startup second.

99
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,240
In fact, all of

100
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,340
the big successes we have at
YC followed this.

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,510
So, for the second half of
today's lecture,

102
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,705
Dustin Moskovitz the
co-founder of Facebook and

103
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,330
Asana, is going to take over
and

104
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,420
talk about why to start a
startup.

105
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,564
We're so surprised by the
amount of

106
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,228
attention that this class
got.

107
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:45,930
That we wanna make sure we

108
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,890
spend a lot of time on the
why.

109
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,150
Okay.
So

110
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,190
the first of the four areas.

111
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,770
A great idea.

112
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,980
It's become popular in

113
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,640
recent years to say that the
idea doesn't matter.

114
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,310
In fact, it's almost uncool
to spend a lot of time

115
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,010
thinking about the idea for
a startup.

116
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,540
You're just supposed to
start.

117
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,280
Throw stuff at the walls.

118
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,770
See what sticks.

119
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,400
And not even spend any time
thinking about if

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
it'll be valuable if it
works.

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,810
And pivots are supposed to
be great.

122
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,580
The more pivots, the better.

123
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,380
So this isn't totally wrong.

124
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,240
Things do evolve in

125
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,930
ways that are difficult to
predict.

126
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,850
And there's a limit to how
much you can figure out,

127
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,980
without actually getting a
product in

128
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,760
the hands of users.

129
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,400
And great execution is at

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,170
least ten times more
important and

131
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,490
a hundred times harder than
a good idea.

132
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,270
But the pendulum has swung
way out of whack here.

133
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,990
A bad idea is still bad.

134
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,510
In the pivot happy world
that we're in today,

135
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,660
it feels really sub optimal.

136
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Great execution towards a
terrible idea

137
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,340
will get you nowhere.

138
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,360
There are exceptions, of
course.

139
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
But most great companies
start with

140
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,470
a great idea, not a pivot.

141
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,130
If you look at successful
pivots, they almost always

142
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,690
are a pivot into something
the founders

143
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,810
themselves wanted, not a
random made up idea.

144
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,060
Airbnb happened because
Brian Chesky couldn't pay

145
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,990
his rent, but he did have
some extra space.

146
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,800
In general, though,

147
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,860
if you look at the track
record of pivots,

148
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,910
they don't become big
companies.

149
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,970
I myself used to believe
ideas didn't matter that

150
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,490
much, but I'm very sure
that's wrong now.

151
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,180
The definition of the idea,

152
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,610
as we talk about it, is very
broad.

153
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,930
It includes the size and the
growth of the market,

154
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,520
the growth strategy for the
company,

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,838
the defensibility strategy
and so on.

156
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:18,810
When you're evaluating an
idea,

157
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,710
you need to think through
all these things,

158
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,450
not just the product.

159
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,500
If it works out, you're
gonna be working on this for

160
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,630
ten years.

161
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,620
So it's worth some real
upfront time

162
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,910
to think we've a long term
value in

163
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,170
the defensibility of the
business.

164
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,770
Even though plans themselves
are worthless,

165
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,410
to exercise a planning is
really valuable and

166
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,810
totally missing in most
startups today.

167
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,170
Long term thinking is so
where,

168
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,612
anywhere, but especially in
startups.

169
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,900
That it's a huge advantage
if you do it.

170
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,570
Remember that the idea will
expand and

171
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,620
become more ambitious as you
go.

172
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
You certainly don't need to
have everything figured out,

173
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,630
in a path from here to world
domination.

174
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,360
But you really want a nice
kernel to start with.

175
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,930
>> You want something that
can develop in

176
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,630
interesting ways.

177
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,340
As you're thinking through
ideas,

178
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,830
another thing that we see
young founders get

179
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,560
wrong all the time, is that
someday you need to

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,860
build a business that's
difficult to replicate.

181
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,160
This is an important part of
a good idea.

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,536
I wanna make this point
again because it's

183
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,040
so important.

184
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,200
The idea should come first,
and

185
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,820
the startup should come
second.

186
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,350
Wait to start a startup,
until you come up

187
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,150
with an idea you feel
compelled to explore.

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,940
This is also the way to

189
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,980
chose between multiple
ideas.

190
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,745
If you have several ideas
that all seem pretty good,

191
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,800
work on the one that you
think about most often when

192
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,820
you're not trying to think
about work.

193
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,940
But we hear again and again
from founders that they

194
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,070
wish they had waited to
start a startup until they

195
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,460
came up with an idea that
they really loved.

196
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,000
Another way of looking at
this is that the best

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,550
companies are almost always
mission oriented.

198
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,400
It's difficult to get large
groups of people to

199
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,550
the extreme levels of focus
and productivity that you

200
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,230
need for a startup to be
successful,

201
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,660
unless the company feels
like an important mission.

202
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,620
And it's usually really hard
to get that without a great

203
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,220
founding idea.

204
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,000
A related advantage of
mission oriented

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,550
ideas is that you yourself
will be dedicated to them.

206
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,620
It takes years and

207
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
years, usually a decade to
create a great startup.

208
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,170
If you don't love and

209
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,660
believe in what you're
building,

210
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,340
you're likely to give up at
some point along the way.

211
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,430
There's no way I know of to
get through the pain of a

212
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,680
startup without belief that
the mission really matters.

213
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,500
A lot of founders,
especially students,

214
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,332
believe that their startup's
only gonna take two or

215
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,690
three years and then after
that they'll work on

216
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,310
what they're really
passionate about.

217
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,480
That almost never works.

218
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
Good startups usually take
ten years.

219
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,710
A third advantage of
mission-oriented

220
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,350
companies is that people
outside the company,

221
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,880
are more willing to help
you.

222
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,740
You'll get more support on

223
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,700
a hard important project
than a derivative one.

224
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,820
When it comes to starting
startups,

225
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,830
in many ways it's easier to

226
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,050
start a hard startup than an
easy startup.

227
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,580
This is one of those
counter-intuitive things.

228
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,860
It takes people a long time
to understand.

229
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,710
It's difficult to overstate
how

230
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,270
important being
mission-driven is, so

231
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,230
I wanna emphasize it one
last time.

232
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,240
Derivative companies,
companies that

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,180
copy an existing idea with
very few new insights,

234
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,240
don't excite people and they
don't compel the teams to

235
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,940
work hard enough to be
successful.

236
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,790
Paul Graham is gonna talk
about how to

237
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,870
get startup ideas next week.

238
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,740
It's something that a lot of
founders struggle with but

239
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,850
it's something I believe you
can get better with it,

240
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,040
better at with practice.

241
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,530
And it's definitely worth
trying to get better at.

242
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,590
The hardest part about
coming up

243
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,950
with great ideas is that

244
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,010
the best ideas often look
terrible at the beginning.

245
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,350
The 13th search engine and

246
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,180
without all the features of
web portal.

247
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,930
Most people thought that was
pointless, search was done,

248
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,500
and anyway, it didn't matter
that much,

249
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,440
Portal's where the value is
at.

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,870
The tenth social network,
and

251
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,582
limited only to college
students with no money?

252
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,770
Also terrible.

253
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,670
MySpace had won, and

254
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,730
who wants college students
as customers, or

255
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,450
a way to stay on strangers'
couches?
