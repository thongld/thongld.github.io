886
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,780
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVhTvQXfibU
And then too, like how do you
explain it to everyone else?

887
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,910
because like it's clearly some
kind of failure.

888
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,700
You failed on hiring, you
failed on integrating,

889
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,790
they failed at their job.

890
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,240
Like some, like it's failure.

891
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:49,013
And so, I'd say look, the
first thing is, when firing

892
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:52,550
the person, you have to really
try to be honest.

893
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,410
And you're feeling like you
failed.

894
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,600
And I think a common reaction
is like,

895
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,090
then there's a couple common
reactions.

896
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,270
One is like, you just suck.

897
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,710
And like, so, like, I'm firing
you.

898
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,910
**** off.

899
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,290
That's not good because it's
not really true.

900
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,180
It may be like, you know,
you're failing that way.

901
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,070
And then another kind of
common mistake is just to

902
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,140
be like you know, too mushy.

903
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,460
It's not you, it's me.

904
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,389
And it, like, feels like some
kind of weird break up

905
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,440
with an ex-boyfriend that you
really didn't like.

906
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,670
But generally, like,

907
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,150
when you hire people it like,
you try to hire the best.

908
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,420
And you hire people who are
qualified to do the job and

909
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,570
generally the reason that they
fail in the job

910
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,400
is you made some mistake in
the hiring

911
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,310
process and that you didn't
match them to the needs of

912
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,940
your company accurately
enough.

913
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,810
That's the number one reason
why this fails.

914
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,940
And so that's generally a good
place to start.

915
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,410
To say, like, here's how we
are.

916
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,450
And here's what I didn't
recognize about us and

917
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,000
about you when I made the
decision.

918
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,300
And now, like, it is what it
is.

919
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,530
So we're going to have to move
on.

920
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,690
And then when you talk to the
employees about it.

921
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,740
Like, this is, and this gets
different.

922
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,510
Which is, look, you can take
somebody's job.

923
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,590
You have to take their job.

924
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,340
And this is something Bill
Campbell taught me.

925
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,550
But you don't have to take
their dignity.

926
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,400
And so it's not necessary to
get up in

927
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,530
front of the company, and say,
I blew that **** out.

928
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,346
I capped his ****.

929
00:39:20,346 --> 00:39:23,430
>>
>> In fact, that's not good

930
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,720
because if somebody feels good
about that, like, you know,

931
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,770
you might feel like proud of
yourself, but

932
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,630
like nobody else feels good
about that.

933
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,170
You know, the right thing to
do is just like thank them for

934
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,210
their work, like let people
know that they're moving on.

935
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,730
And you don't really have to

936
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,680
explain all their personal
details.

937
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,459
It's more important to leave
them with their dignity.

938
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,550
And like let them go on to
live another day because look,

939
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,490
what you say at that meeting?

940
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,660
That's their reputation.

941
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,120
Because everybody in your
company is going to get a call

942
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,650
on that person when they try
and get their next job, so

943
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,180
if you start saying a bunch of
BS about them?

944
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,830
Like that's not going to be
good.

945
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,020
And it's not going to get
interpreted as like,

946
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,640
we screwed up.

947
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,440
It's going to get interpreted
as you know, he screwed up.

948
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,960
And so they're kind of two
different things.

949
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,610
You have to be very honest
with them but

950
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,310
you have to make sure you

951
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,842
preserve their dignity when
you talk to the company.

952
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:13,953
Yes sir.

953
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,385
>> So I was reading your book
yesterday and one, like,

954
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:20,823
I started getting heart
palpitations because it.

955
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:21,607
>> Sorry about that.

956
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:24,432
>> Yeah like, elsewhere.

957
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:27,710
And so one question for me, I
think for everyone is

958
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,791
how did you in particular deal
with all the stress?

959
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:36,153
Like, was it, like,
meditating, hip-hop.

960
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:36,760
>>
>> What do you do?

961
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,965
>> So the question was, how
do,

962
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:42,830
how do I deal with all the
stress of, being CEO.

963
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,500
And the answer is I used to be

964
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,890
six foot four and good
looking.

965
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,580
>> So clearly not very well.

966
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,280
I get asked that a lot and

967
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,590
I, I really don't have a great
answer for it.

968
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,950
I mean, I think that the one,
I

969
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,870
have a wonderful wife who's
sitting right here.

970
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,940
So I'll say that.

971
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,230
>> So if you're married to
somebody, if you're married to

972
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,010
somebody who's supportive,
that makes it,

973
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,410
like 1,000 times easier.

974
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,790
If, if I did not,

975
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,033
if I wasn't, I would
definitely probably be dead,.

976
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:21,030
>>
>> But, but

977
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,600
the one thing with stress is
you've got to keep your

978
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,330
focus on what you can do, not
what happened to you.

979
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,930
And that's a, it's a really
hard thing to do, because it's

980
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,720
constantly, and people are
always asking you about it,

981
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,730
like, what the **** are we
going to do?

982
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,310
We're going to die, we're
running out of cash.

983
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,740
It's all going to be over
soon.

984
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,960
But you can't focus on that.

985
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,990
You have to focus on, okay,
like what are my options?

986
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,300
What can I do?

987
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,310
And where can I go?

988
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,910
And the better you are at
that,

989
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,440
the kind of higher your chance
of, for success.

990
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,410
Yes.

991
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,858
>> How did Toussaint get the
French generals to work for

992
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:56,311
him, like what was his pitch?

993
00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:58,366
>> Oh, so this is a great
question.

994
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:00,488
How did Toussaint get the
French generals to

995
00:42:00,488 --> 00:42:01,183
work for him?

996
00:42:01,183 --> 00:42:04,630
And the reason was that they
were so.

997
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,390
Shocked that he didn't kill
them because he was like,

998
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,510
they, their perspective is
we're fighting the slave army,

999
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,260
we're fighting the savage
army.

1000
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,330
They're going to kill us.

1001
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,800
And so when he said, like,
we're not going to kill you,

1002
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
that was such a shock to their
system that it

1003
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,200
completely reoriented their
whole way of thinking.

1004
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,870
And they actually became much
more loyal to him than they

1005
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,590
ever were to France.

1006
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,720
And they actually borrowed
that technique,

1007
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,040
interestingly, from Julius
Caesar who he had studied.

1008
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,230
He was a very unusual slave in
the sense that,

1009
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:41,270
his, his owner recognized how
smart he was and put him in

1010
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,220
the library, because he wanted
Toussainte to eventually run

1011
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,800
the plantation for him.

1012
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,670
And so the person that he
studied most of all in

1013
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,010
his masters' library was
Julius Caesar.

1014
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,240
And so he borrowed that
technique from him.

1015
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,460
But applied in a much kind of
more dramatic context.

1016
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,750
And so, his army was kind of.

1017
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:08,250
He had British, French,
Spanish slaves.

1018
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,900
And mulattos, who, most of the
mulattos in Haiti,

1019
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,400
at that time were pro slavery.

1020
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,510
So that was another issue, but
his leadership was so

1021
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,350
great everybody wanted to join
him.

1022
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,130
Yes?

1023
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,250
>> How do you incorporate that
same ideology into people

1024
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,470
who were previously against
you, on your side?

1025
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,330
>> Yeah, so.

1026
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,500
You know, and it, it's,
different in different ways

1027
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,900
but a lot of it, you know, his
whole strategy.

1028
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,720
And, and look, I'm sorry the
question was, how do you, get

1029
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,120
people, how do you incorporate
Toussainte's ideology and

1030
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,750
get people who were previously
against you on your side.

1031
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,600
And I would just say, like,
what he did, in general.

1032
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,340
Is, is the right thing, which
is to,

1033
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,450
basically you have to show
them a better way.

1034
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,930
You know as a leader, if
someone's your enemy, and

1035
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,960
you need to convert them over.

1036
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,300
And this happens in business
too.

1037
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,650
Where like somebody's like a
competitor or something, and

1038
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,540
you want to bring them over.

1039
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,390
But you want to bring them
over, you know,

1040
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,270
you don't want to bring the,
all the unethical people

1041
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,790
who'll switch competitor to
competitor over.

1042
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,520
And it really is, like, your
culture has to be elevated.

1043
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,010
Your mission to be elevated.

1044
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,660
Your way of doing things has
to be just better.

1045
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:18,860
And that was the thing that
was so

1046
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,802
compelling, for, for the
other.

1047
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:22,680
Yes,.

1048
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,440
Yes.
>> Okay, so

1049
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,630
going up, your last name's
actually.

1050
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,208
It's just sort of like
introducing the bill, and

1051
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:31,670
it's like Have you built like
a culture around people?

1052
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,118
You know, all the
entrepreneurs you

1053
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,847
work with that sort of
differentiated you in

1054
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:36,070
the market from all other VCs?

1055
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,915
>> Probably not the best
question for me.

1056
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:39,710
I could ask Sam that.

1057
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,710
I don't know, so the question
is, you know,

1058
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,669
have we built a culture at
Andresen Oritz that is

1059
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,310
differentiated us from all of
their VCs?

1060
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,780
I feel like, you know, that's
certainly the goal, and,

1061
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,470
you know, we've been around
for five years now,

1062
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,440
and, you know, the, the, the
attempt that we

1063
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,780
made at it, and it's for the
rest of the world to judge if

1064
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,470
we succeeded was basically
this, that.

1065
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,220
You know in the old days of
VC,

1066
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,700
when I was an entrepreneur.

1067
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,220
The basic idea was like you'd
have an entrepreneur and, or

1068
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,360
an inventor, and they'd get a
company to a point, and

1069
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,360
then at that point they'd
either be like ready to

1070
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,445
be CEO, or you would go find a
CEO to replace them and

1071
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:24,850
build quote, unquote the
company.

1072
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,530
Our kind of cultural
philosophy was like,

1073
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,570
the founder inventor is
special so,

1074
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:33,860
we're going to design the firm
and

1075
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,910
the culture of the firm to
help the founder develop into

1076
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,100
a CEO, and so we do a lot of
systematic things different.

1077
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,990
The two biggest are one,

1078
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,750
all of our partners are kind
of founders, CEOs.

1079
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,780
So that you get somebody, our
original motto is

1080
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,310
some experience required, it's
a joke.

1081
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,490
>> If you were going to advise
the CEO,

1082
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,130
you have to have kind of been
a CEO, imagine that.

1083
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,820
That's why I like Sam, he used
to be a CEO,

1084
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,270
he doesn't talk about it that
much, but

1085
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,349
he, he was a CEO and good at
it.

1086
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,040
And then the second part is
that a professional CEO would

1087
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,840
bring in, in the old days is,
is a network of just tons of

1088
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,090
people that he would know from
like all kinds of,

1089
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,580
you know, guys who, who bought
technology at big corporations

1090
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,230
to, like important partners in
the field.

1091
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,530
Like, guys like Google and
Facebook to, you know people

1092
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,770
in the press that, that he or
she might know and so forth.

1093
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,430
And so we try to basically
build that

1094
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,078
network on your behalf, at the
firm.

1095
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:34,200
And we probably,

1096
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,310
I think we do a better job of
that then anyone else.

1097
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,710
So that, those are the way
that,

1098
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,220
that we try to be differen.

1099
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,140
One more question.

1100
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,950
>> Yes, one more question.

1101
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,190
Yes, the front row.

1102
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:46,570
>> Is this like, putting
yourself in others,

1103
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,320
people's shoes is very
important in management.

1104
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,220
So, can you give us some tips
to do it?

1105
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:55,916
>> Yeah, so.

1106
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,200
>> How can you.

1107
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,800
>> Yeah, so, so,

1108
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,980
putting yourself in other
people's shoes is,

1109
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,090
is difficult in management.

1110
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,970
Can you think about how to do
it in daily life?

1111
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:03,670
It's hard.

1112
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,600
It's hard in daily life.

1113
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,170
It's even harder in
management.

1114
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,400
Because it's a stress of the
moment, right?

1115
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,210
Like, a great employee is
asking you for

1116
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,970
a raise, it is very hard not
to respond.

1117
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,810
It's, it's a very,

1118
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,470
because like you do not
want to lose them, and

1119
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,480
like they're not asking you
for a raise randomly.

1120
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,950
They're asking you a raise for
a reason.

1121
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,870
And so to say okay, you know,
particularly if you don't have

1122
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,290
a process in place to go stop,
like back out.

1123
00:47:27,573 --> 00:47:33,698
I would just say that, and
it's a key thing in being,

1124
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:38,214
a leader is you've got to
pause yourself.

1125
00:47:38,214 --> 00:47:39,306
Like if somebody comes to

1126
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:42,120
you with something that you
know is important.

1127
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,640
But you want to feel like, you
know, when you're a leader you

1128
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,080
want to feel like you have all
the answers.

1129
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,840
Like right now you guys are
asking me questions,

1130
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,840
if I don't know the answer
I'll make something up.

1131
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,230
Because I want you to think
I'm real smart.

1132
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,750
and, and it's important, I,

1133
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,030
I'd say the most important
thing is to pause.

1134
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,890
Like so if you know something
is really important and

1135
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,390
you haven't thought it
through.

1136
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,920
Says to say,

1137
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,460
you know, look, I'm taking
this really seriously but

1138
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,530
I have to pause because I have
to think it through from all

1139
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,230
perspectives and I'm going to
come back, and, and

1140
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,450
I end up doing that a lot just
because there are a lot of

1141
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:18,210
things that you run into that
you haven't seen before, and

1142
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,780
I'll tell you, you, you know,

1143
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,590
most CEOs, including myself,
learn this the hard way.

1144
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:27,390
You walk in you kind of step
in it like three or

1145
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,020
four times.

1146
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,420
You go okay, I'm going to
sneak away with this.

1147
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,160
Nobody's going to see me give
them the raise.

1148
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,860
I'm going to do it and

1149
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,900
it's going to be all under the
covers, confidentiality baby.

1150
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,810
And then like it comes up and

1151
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,570
it blows up in your face three
weeks later.

1152
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,730
And you're like, oh my God,
what have I done, or

1153
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,368
three months later, or even a
year later.

1154
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,580
And then, you know,

1155
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,820
once, it's a year later, it's
a huge problem.

1156
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,370
Like so you've taken what's a
little emotional problem and

1157
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,360
you've turned it into a forest
fire.

1158
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,210
You know we call it the kimchi
problem.

1159
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,600
The deeper you bury it the
hotter it gets.

1160
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,180
>> It's a Korean joke.

1161
00:49:06,855 --> 00:49:10,400
But but, you know, it takes
practice.

1162
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,780
I would say it takes practice.

1163
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,350
And it's very difficult to do.

1164
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,120
And I would say, you know,

1165
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,650
like, some of the, my friend,
Bill Campbell.

1166
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,970
This is his big skill.

1167
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,280
Like, this is what he's so
great at.

1168
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,650
People always try and describe
him to me.

1169
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:23,880
And I'm like, that's not him
at all.

1170
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,970
That's not what he's good at.

1171
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,550
Like, he's not good at that or
that.

1172
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,290
He's good at this.

1173
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,520
He's good at seeing the
company through the eyes of

1174
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,690
the employees.

1175
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,790
And, it's, like I said, if
you, if you're good at that,

1176
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,770
you'll be in a, very likely in
an elite, leader.

1177
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,180
So thank you, thank you.
