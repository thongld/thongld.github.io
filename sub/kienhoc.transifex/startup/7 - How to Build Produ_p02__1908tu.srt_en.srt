255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,190
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_LgBAGYyo
back end services is as easy
as sort of dragging up and

256
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,460
down, different sort of nobs
and levers.

257
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,820
It's gonna be beautifully
used, and

258
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,570
it looks fairly easy to
scale.

259
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,460
Since we're in a room full
of computer science people,

260
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,880
I think you'll appreciate
this.

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,660
This is Chocolat.

262
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,750
This is a code editor, and

263
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,320
they only have one call to
action.

264
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,270
When the time limit is up,
they say, everything in

265
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,050
terms of all the pieces are
exactly the same except we

266
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,600
change the font.

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
To comic sans.

268
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,540
And what they're basically
saying is like hey

269
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,932
we know who our users are,
who our real customers are.

270
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,030
They're gonna be the people
who care about this.

271
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,480
This is Hurl, this is a
website for

272
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,580
checking htp requests, and
sometimes the places where

273
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,650
you get errors are
opportunities for

274
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,527
first moments,

275
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,390
you had a four of four this
is what you get it,

276
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,040
when we need help oftentimes
what we do is where we

277
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,770
create like really beautiful
mark, marketing materials.

278
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,820
But when you actually need,
like, documentation we sort

279
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,850
of like skimp out on sort of
design features.

280
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,060
And this is a point that,
like,

281
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,830
you see happen over and over
again.

282
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,520
A company that gets this
right is MailChimp.

283
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,470
And what they did was they
redesigned all of their

284
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,350
help guides so that they
looked like magazine covers.

285
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,890
And overnight, basically,

286
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,920
readership goes up on all
these features.

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,080
And customer support for
these things that sort of

288
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,220
help people optimize emails
goes down.

289
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,400
Speaking of documentation,
stripe.

290
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,550
What's interesting about an
API company is that there is

291
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,340
no UX.

292
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,810
The UX is actually just
documentation, right?

293
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,390
And there's opportunities
even in documentation.

294
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,720
Sort of the enchant and
amaze.

295
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,660
So one of the things that I

296
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,140
love about them is their
examples are wonderful.

297
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,280
But if you're actually,
like,

298
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,830
sort of logging into the
app,

299
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,340
one of the things that is a
super pain for most people,

300
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,770
when you're dealing with
most people's APIs, is,

301
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,920
like, grabbing your API
credentials and keys.

302
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,610
And what Stripe does is it
says oh,

303
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,610
if you're logged into the
app.

304
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,390
We automatically put

305
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,110
your API credentials into
the examples, so you only

306
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,090
have to copy paste once when
trying to learn their API.

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,050
When Wufoo wanted to launch
the third version of our API

308
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,940
we realized like, Okay, that
finally this is good enough

309
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,070
that we want people to sort
of build on top of it.

310
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,040
We were trying to figure
out,

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,740
like, how do we launch this
out to the world,

312
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,550
that sort of has our
personality behind it.

313
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,430
Because a lot of people,

314
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,000
they usually do things like
a programming API contest,

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,960
and they give out iPads and
iPhones.

316
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,830
And it makes you look like
everyone else.

317
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,440
And so, in our company one
weird value to

318
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,740
have it's a quirk of us,

319
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,570
is that the co-founders are
big medieval nuts.

320
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,510
And we take everyone out to
Medieval Times every single

321
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,130
year, on the anniversary of
the founding of the company.

322
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,760
And so, we said we have to
do something in that flavor.

323
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,650
And so we contacted the guys
at armor.com,

324
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,800
we said can you forward us a
custom battle-ax.

325
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,630
And what we said was if

326
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,580
you win our programming
contest you would win one.

327
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,800
The result is like people
wanted to talk about this.

328
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,380
It's something that people
wanted to work on cuz

329
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,860
they wanted to be able to
say it like I'm programming.

330
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,420
For a weapon.

331
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:46,850
And what's cool is we had
over 25 different

332
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,790
applications created for us
of quality and quantity that

333
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,410
we could not have paid for
on the budget and

334
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,820
the sort of time that we had
for this.

335
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,150
We got things like an iPhone
app and

336
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,720
Android and WordPress
plugins, right?

337
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,850
And all because what we did
was we changed how

338
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,520
people wanna talk about the
origin story of

339
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,779
how they're interacting with
one of our services.

340
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,990
And go like all day long of
going over these examples.

341
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,000
But I'm gonna short cut this
by saying,

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,750
you should just subscribe a
little bit of details.

343
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,480
It's just basically tons of
screen shots of software

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,370
that's just doing it right.

345
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,160
That shows that they're
being

346
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,099
conscientious of the user
and the customers.

347
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,799
When it comes to long term
relationships or

348
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,843
marriages, the only research
that we ended up having to

349
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:37,390
read was the stuff that was
done by John Gottman.

350
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,520
He's been featured in This
American Life,

351
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,490
in Malcolm Gladwell's books.

352
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,040
He's a marriage researcher
up in Seattle.

353
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,250
And he has an interesting
parlor trick that he can do.

354
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,730
He can watch a video tape of
a couple fighting about some

355
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,320
issue for 15 minutes.

356
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,900
And predict with an 85%
accuracy rate whether that

357
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,930
couple will be together or

358
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,630
not, or divorced in four
years.

359
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,770
If he increases that video
up to an hour.

360
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,620
And asks them to also talk
about their hopes and

361
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,540
dreams.

362
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,167
That prediction rating goes
up to 94%.

363
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:06,150
They showed these same video
tapes to marriage

364
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,700
counselors, successfully
married couples,

365
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,630
sociologists, psychiatrists,
priests, et cetera and

366
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,680
they can't predict with
random chance whether people

367
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,250
are gonna be together or
not.

368
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,590
So John Gauntman understands
something fundamental about.

369
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,110
How relationships work in
the long term.

370
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,650
And that basically how we
fight, even in a short term

371
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,030
period can indicate sort of
the whole system and

372
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,140
what it's gonna look like.

373
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,900
And one of the surprising
things he discovered,

374
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,420
it's not that

375
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,430
successfully married people
don't fight at all.

376
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,430
It turns out everybody
fights.

377
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,090
And we all fight about the
exact same things money,

378
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,300
kids, sex, time and others.

379
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,263
And others are things like
jealousy and in-laws.

380
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,543
To bring this around, right,
you can actually attribute

381
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,543
every single one of these to
problems that you see in

382
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,931
customer support when you're
building out your products.

383
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,532
Right, so.

384
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,447
This costs too much.

385
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,401
I'm having problems with a
credit card.

386
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,260
If you're building a service
that helps people deal with

387
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,190
their clients they're very

388
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,480
sensitive about anything
happening with that.

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,530
Performance.

390
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,750
How long you're up and how
fast.

391
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,110
Others are I said jealousy
and in-laws.

392
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,960
Right, so that's competition
and partnerships.

393
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,310
So anything weird happening
there,

394
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,090
people are gonna write to
you about.

395
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,520
And the reason I like to
think about this in

396
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,430
terms of customer support is
that in every ones that

397
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,920
are processing of like a
conversion funnel,

398
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,790
customer support is the
thing that happens in

399
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,100
between every one of these
steps.

400
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,720
It's the reason why people
don't make it

401
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,650
further down there.

402
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,629
It's the thing that prevents
conversion from happening.

403
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,130
Now, as we were thinking
through all these ideas and

404
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,680
as we were building up the
company,

405
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,470
we realized that there's a
big problem about how

406
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,760
everyone sort of starts
their company or

407
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,230
build up their sort of
engineering teams.

408
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,760
And that is that there's a
broken feedback loop there.

409
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
People are divorced from the
consequences of

410
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,810
their actions.

411
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,580
And this is the result of
actually the natural

412
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,600
evolution of how most
companies get founded,

413
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,880
especially by technical
co-founders, right.

414
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,630
Before launch it is a time
of bliss, nirvana, and

415
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,050
opportunity, right?

416
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,470
Nothing that you do is
wrong, right?

417
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,850
By your hand, which you feel
is like god, everything that

418
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,750
you write, every line of
code feels perfect, right,

419
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,770
and is ingenious to you.

420
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,830
The thing that happens is
after launch reality sort of

421
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,030
sets in and then all these
other tasks sort of

422
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,579
come into place that we have
to deal with.

423
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,720
Now what technical
co-founders wanna do is get

424
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,240
back to that initial state
and so what we often do,

425
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,380
and what we often see is
that companies start

426
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,240
siloing off all these other
things that actually is

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,410
what makes a start up or a
company sort of real, right?

428
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,540
And have other people do
them.

429
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,590
To, in our minds, these
other tasks are inferior.

430
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,660
Right?
And we have other people in

431
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,310
the company do them.

432
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,580
And so for us, what we're
trying to figure out

433
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,590
is how do we change software
development so that we

434
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,970
inject some values that we
don't talk about enough?

435
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,970
Responsibility,
accountability,

436
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,780
humility, modesty.

437
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,300
Right, and we called this,
like a lot of other people,

438
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,720
we had an acronym, Support
Driven Development, and

439
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,900
it's very similar to TDD or
other agile practice.

440
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,590
It's a way of creating high
quality software, but

441
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,820
it's super simple.

442
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,182
You don't need like, a
SCRUM,

443
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,610
you don't need a bunch of
post-it notes, all you

444
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,910
have to do is make everyone
do customer support.

445
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
And what you end up having
is

446
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,990
you fix the feedback loop,
right?

447
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,450
The people who build the
software are the ones

448
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,240
supporting it and

449
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,940
you get all these sort of
nice benefits as a result.

450
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,340
So one of them is, support
responsible developers and

451
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,120
designers and people who
build the stuff,

452
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,600
they give the very best
support.

453
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Now we're not the first
person to think of this.

454
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Paul English was a big
proporter of this at Kayak,

455
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,750
and what he did was install
a red customer support phone

456
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,640
line in the middle of the
engineering floor.

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,950
And they were just regular
customer support calls.

458
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,890
And people would ask him
often times,

459
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,560
why would you pay engineers
$120,000 or

460
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,390
more to do something that
you can pay other people

461
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,890
a fraction of to handle in
like a call center?

462
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,560
And he says, well, after the
second or

463
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,930
third time that phone rings
and the engineer gets

464
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,990
the same problem they stop
what they're doing, they fix

465
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,940
the bug, and we stop getting
phone calls about it.

466
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,670
It, it's a way of having Q-A
in a sort of

467
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,840
nice elegant solution.

468
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,820
Now, John Gotman talks about
the reason that we often

469
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,600
break up with one another as
due to four major causes and

470
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,390
their warning signs.

471
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,300
He calls them the four
horsemen, right?

472
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,830
Criticism, contempt,
defensiveness,

473
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,680
and stonewalling.

474
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,590
Now, criticism is basically
people starting to focus,

475
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,350
not just on the specific
issue at hand, but

476
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,448
on the overarching issues.

477
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:45,780
Like, you never, right,
listen to your users or

478
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,480
you never think about us all
the time.

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,980
Right?

480
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,880
Contempt is when someone is
purposely trying to

481
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,170
insult somebody.

482
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,620
Defensiveness is not trying
to take accountability

483
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,810
trying to make excuses for
the actions.

484
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,532
And stonewalling is
basically shutting down.

485
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:07,120
Stonewalling, to John
Gotman, is, is one of

486
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,026
the worst things that we can
do in a relationship.

487
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,593
Hold up.

488
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,711
And oftentimes, you know, we
don't worry much about this

489
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,970
in customer se, criticism
and contempt.

490
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,770
Right?
Defensiveness,

491
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,530
you see this all the time,
all the times in companies,

492
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,790
especially as they get
older.

493
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,320
But stonewalling, this is
something I

494
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,230
see happen with start-ups
all the time.

495
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,100
You get a bunch of customer
support sort of

496
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,380
coming in and you just think
I don't need to answer it.

497
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,130
I don't need to respond.

498
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,420
Right?
And

499
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,410
that act of just not even
getting back to

500
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,290
them is one of the worst
things you can do.

501
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,160
And it's probably some of
the biggest causes of

502
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,034
churn in the early stages of
start-ups.

503
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,430
This is how support worked
out with Wufoo.

504
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,250
When we were acquired we had
about 500,000 users on

505
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,230
the system, 5 million people
used Wufoo forms and

506
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,940
reports, whether they knew
it or not, and

507
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,100
all those people got support
from the same ten people,

508
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,640
and usually it was
