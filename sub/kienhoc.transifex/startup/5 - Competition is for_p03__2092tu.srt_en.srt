571
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,500
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo
there was tremendous
innovation, but

572
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,650
no one made any money.

573
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,310
So, you know?

574
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,360
Describe manufacturing in
the 1980's.

575
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,340
You could im-,

576
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,410
you could do a better disk,

577
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,500
build a better disk drive
than anybody else.

578
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,260
You could take over the
whole world.

579
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,960
And two years later someone
else would come along and

580
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,070
replace yours.

581
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,810
And the course of 15 years,

582
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,520
you got vastly improved disk
drives, so

583
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,760
it had great benefit to
consumers, but it didn't

584
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,140
actually help the people who
started these companies.

585
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,590
And so there's always this
question about having a huge

586
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,640
breakthrough in technology,
but then also being able to

587
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,490
say, explain why, yours will
be the last breakthrough, or

588
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,660
at least the last
breakthrough for

589
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,960
a long time, or when you
make a breakthrough.

590
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,110
And then you can keep
improving on it

591
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,790
at a quick enough pace that
no one can ever catch up.

592
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,620
So, if you have a structure
of structure of

593
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,530
the future where there's a
lot of innovation and

594
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,690
other people will come up
with new things in

595
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,430
the thing you're working on.

596
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,050
That's great for society.

597
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,090
It's actually not that good
for

598
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,600
your business, typically.

599
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,560
And then economies of scale,
we've already talked about.

600
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,070
So I think this last mover
thing is very critical.

601
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm always, you know,

602
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,200
I don't wanna overdo the
chess analogies, but

603
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,350
the first mover in chess is
someone who plays white.

604
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,860
White is about a 1/3 of a
pawn advantage, so

605
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,370
there's a small advantage to
going first.

606
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,980
You wanna be the last mover,
who wins the game, so

607
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,911
there's always the,
Capablanca world champion,

608
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:38,670
Capablanca must begin by
studying the end game, and

609
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,440
I do think that's, while I
wouldn't say that's the only

610
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,550
thing you should study.

611
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,870
I think the sort of
perspective of

612
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,330
asking these questions, why
will this still be

613
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,230
the leading company 10, 15,
20 years from now, is a,

614
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,598
is a really critical one to
try to think through.

615
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:56,920
Let me, let me sort of,

616
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,810
I want to sort of go in two
slightly other directions

617
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,930
with this monopoly vs
competition idea.

618
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:08,170
And I think so I think this
is the, the central idea,

619
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,210
in my mind for, for business
for starting business for

620
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,850
thinking about them and
there are some, interesting

621
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,960
perspectives I think it
gives on the whole you know,

622
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,050
on the whole history of
innovation and

623
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,540
technology and science.

624
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,040
Because, yeah we've, we've
lived through,

625
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,490
250, 300 years of incredible
technological progress in

626
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,170
you know many, many
different domains.

627
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,670
You know, steam engine to
railways to

628
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,040
telephones, refrigeration,
household appliances,

629
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,750
you know the computer
revolution, aviation.

630
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,230
All sorts of different areas
of

631
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,680
technological innovation and
then there's sort of

632
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,170
analogous thing that one can
say about science,

633
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,630
where we've lived through
centuries of enormous

634
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,150
amounts of innovation in
science as well.

635
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,990
And the thing that I think
people always miss when

636
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,860
they think about these
things is that because X and

637
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,580
Y are independent variables,
some of these things can be

638
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,520
extremely valuable
innovations.

639
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
But the people who invent
them,

640
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,360
who come up with them, do
not get rewarded for this.

641
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,130
And certainly, you can go
back to, you need to

642
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,650
create X dollars in value,
you create Y percent of X.

643
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:29,750
I would suggest that the
history of science has

644
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,420
generally been one where Y
is 0% across the board.

645
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,720
The scientists never make
any money.

646
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,310
They're always deluded into
thinking that they live in

647
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,680
a just universe that will
reward them for

648
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,820
their work and for their
inventions.

649
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,530
And this is probably the
fundamental delusion that

650
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,190
scientists tend to suffer
from in our society.

651
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,116
And even in technology,
there are, sort of,

652
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:54,518
many different areas of
technology,

653
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:57,594
where there were great
innovations that created

654
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:59,632
tremendous value for
society.

655
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:04,499
But the people did not
actually capture that much

656
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:05,928
of the value.

657
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:10,761
And so I think there is a
sort of whole history of.

658
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:11,491
Science and

659
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:14,632
technology that can be told
from the perspective of

660
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:17,050
how much value was actually
captured.

661
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:22,020
And certainly, there are
entire sectors where

662
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,800
people didn't capture
anything.

663
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,550
So you're the smartest
Physicist of the 20th

664
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,860
century, you come up with
special relativity,

665
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,290
you come up with general
relativity.

666
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,010
You don't get to be a
billionaire,

667
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,460
you don't even get to be a
millionaire.

668
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,640
It somehow doesn't work that
way.

669
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
The railroads, incredibly
valuable.

670
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,928
Most of them just went
bankrupt,

671
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:42,539
because there was too much
competition.

672
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,290
Wright brothers, you fly the
first plane,

673
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,490
you don't make any money.

674
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,120
And so I think there is sort
of a structure to

675
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,150
these industries, that's
very important.

676
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,011
And I think the thing that's
actually rare,

677
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:58,050
are the success cases.

678
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,366
Most the, so it's actually
unique when you really think

679
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,584
about the history in this,
in this 250 year sweep,

680
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,650
it's unusual, Y is almost
always zero percent.

681
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,390
It's always zero in science.

682
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,360
It's almost always in
technology, and

683
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,980
so it's very rare where
people made money.

684
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,710
You know, the early,

685
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,870
the late 18th, early 19th
century, the first

686
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,240
industrial revolution was
textile mills, steam engine,

687
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,780
the sort of automated
things.

688
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,490
And you had these relentless
improvements,

689
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,380
that people improved
efficiency of

690
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,470
textile factories,
manufacturing generally.

691
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,090
At a clip of 5 to 7% every
year.

692
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:31,000
Year after year, decade
after decade.

693
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,580
You had 60, 70 years of

694
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,434
tremendous improvement from
1780 to 1850.

695
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,170
But even in 1850, most of
the wealth in Britain

696
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,140
was still held by the landed
aristocracy.

697
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,195
The workers didn't, you
know,

698
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,364
the workers didn't make that
much,

699
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,920
the capitalists didn't make
that much either.

700
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,820
It was all competed away.

701
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,910
There were hundreds of

702
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,220
people running textiles
factories.

703
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,675
It was an industry that
just,

704
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:58,050
the structure of the
competition prevented people

705
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,370
from making any money.

706
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,740
And so I think there are, in
my mind,

707
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,180
there probably are only two
broad categories in

708
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,750
the entire history, the last
250 years,

709
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,870
where people have actually
come up with new things, and

710
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,438
made money doing so.

711
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:16,580
One is these sort of
vertically integrated

712
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,940
complex monopolies which
people did build in

713
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,100
the second industrial
revolution at the end of

714
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,440
the 19th and started the
20th century.

715
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,770
And so this was like Ford,
it was the vertically

716
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,190
integrated oil companies
like Standard Oil.

717
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,066
And what these vertically
integrated monopolies

718
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:35,690
typically required was this
very complex coordination.

719
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,560
You've got a lot of pieces
to fit together in

720
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,280
just the right way, when you
assembled it,

721
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,190
you had a tremendous
advantage.

722
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,000
This is actually done
surprisingly little today.

723
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,030
And so I think this is sort
of a business form that

724
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,930
when people can pull it off
is very valuable.

725
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,560
It's typically fairly
capital intensive.

726
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,885
We live sort of in a, in a
culture where is very hard

727
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:01,055
to get people to buy into
anything that's super

728
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:04,520
complicated, and it takes
very long to build.

729
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,594
But I, you know,

730
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:08,464
when I sort of think about
my colleague Elon Musk

731
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:11,549
from PayPal success with
Tesla and Space X, I think

732
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,779
the key to these companies
was the complex vertically

733
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:17,700
integrated monopoly
structure they had.

734
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,302
So if you sort of look at
Tesla or Space X you ask,

735
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:23,430
you know, was there sort of
single breakthrough?

736
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,190
They certainly innovated on
a lot of dimensions.

737
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't think there was

738
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,110
a single tennex breakthrough
and battery storage,

739
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,400
or you know, maybe working
on some things in rocketry.

740
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,145
But they hadn't,

741
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,330
there was no sort of single
massive breakthrough, but

742
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,290
what was really impressive
was integrating all these

743
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,390
pieces together, and doing
it in a way that was more

744
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,640
vertically integrated than
most of their competitors.

745
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,590
So, Tesla,

746
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,560
you also integrated the car
distributors, so

747
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,280
they wouldn't steal all the
money, as has happened with

748
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,186
the rest of the car industry
in the US.

749
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:56,450
Or SpaceX, you basically
pulled in

750
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,000
all the subcontractors where
most of the large aerospace

751
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,020
companies have single source
subcontractors that are able

752
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,940
to sort of charge monopoly
profits, and

753
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,200
make it very hard for

754
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,600
the integrated aerospace
companies to make money.

755
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,040
And so vertical integration
I think is sort of a very

756
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,721
under explored modality of
technological progress,

757
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,530
that people would do well to
look at more.

758
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,756
And then I think there is,
there is something about

759
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:27,790
software itself that's very,
very powerful.

760
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,870
Software has these
incredible economies of

761
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,990
scale, these low marginal
costs and there is something

762
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,460
about the world of bits, as
opposed to the world of

763
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,350
adams, where you can often
get very fast adoption.

764
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,680
And, and the fast adoption
is critical to capturing and

765
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,670
taking over markets because
even if you

766
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,510
have a small market if the
adoption rate is too slow,

767
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,050
there'll be enough time for
other people to

768
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,220
enter that market, and
compete with you.

769
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,110
Whereas if you have a small
to mid size market, and

770
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,540
have a fast adoption rate.

771
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,090
You cannot take over this
market.

772
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,630
And so I think this is

773
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,490
one of the reasons Silicon
Valley has done so well, and

774
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,820
why software has been this
phenomenal industry.

775
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,480
And what I, what I would
suggest, what I would want

776
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,780
to leave you with is there
are sort of these different

777
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,450
rationalizations people give
for why certain things work,

778
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,100
and why certain things don't
work.

779
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,020
And I think these
rationalizations always

780
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,960
obscure this question of
creating X dollars in value,

781
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,020
and capturing Y percent of
X.

782
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,890
So the science
rationalization we're

783
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,290
always told, is that

784
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,420
the scientists aren't
interested in making money.

785
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,060
They're doing it for

786
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
charitable reasons, and that
you're not

787
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,360
a good scientist if you're
motivated by money.

788
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,850
And I'm not even saying
people should

789
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,880
always be motivated by money
or something like this.

790
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,420
But I think we should be a
little more critical of this

791
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,430
as a rationalization.

792
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,710
We should ask, is this a
rationalization

793
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,730
to obscure the fact that Y
equals zero percent.

794
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,750
And the scientists are
operating in this sort of

795
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,865
world where all the
innovation is

796
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,979
effectively competed away,
and

797
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:59,190
they can't capture any of it
directly.

798
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,720
The software distortion that
often happens,

799
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,130
is because people are making
such a vast fortunes in

800
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,740
software, we infer that this
is the most

801
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,400
valuable thing in the world
being done full stop.

802
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,830
And so if people at Twitter
make billions of dollars,

803
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,120
it must be that Twitter is
worth far more than anything

804
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
that Einstein did.

805
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,800
What that sort of
rationalization tends to

806
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,090
obscure, is again that X and
Y are independent variables.

807
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,630
And there are these
businesses where you

808
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,250
capture a lot of X and there
others where you don't.

809
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,694
And so, I do think the
history of innovation has

810
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:37,053
been this history where the
microeconomics,

811
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:40,499
the structure of these
industries has mattered

812
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,162
a tremendous amount.

813
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:46,960
And when there is sort of
this

814
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,430
story where some people have
made vast fortunes, because

815
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,050
they were in industries with
the right structure, and

816
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,930
other people made nothing at
all, because they were in

817
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,760
these sort of very
competitive things.

818
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,330
And we shouldn't just
rationalize that away,

819
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,640
I think it's worth
understanding this better.

820
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,060
And then finally, let me
come back to this

821
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,330
sort of overarching theme
for

822
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,370
this talk, this competition
is for losers idea.

823
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,030
Which is always a
provocative way to

824
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,780
title things, because we
always think of

825
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,150
the losers as the people who
are not good at competing.

826
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,540
We think of the losers as
the people who are slow on

827
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,390
the sports team, on the
track team in high school,

828
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,520
or who do a little bit less
well on the standardized

829
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,870
tests, and don't get into
the right schools.

830
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,220
So we always think of losers
as people who can't compete,

831
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,300
and I want us to really
rethink,

832
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,460
and revalue this and
consider whether it's

833
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,980
possible that competition
itself is off.

834
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,450
That we've sort of, it's not
just the case and

835
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,420
we don't understand this

836
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,280
monopoly competition
dichotomy intellectually.

837
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
So that's, sort of,

838
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,540
why you wouldn't understand
intellectually,

839
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,840
because people lie about it.

840
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,500
It's distorted.

841
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,730
We have all these history of
innovation

842
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,720
rationalizes what's
happening in all these very,

843
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,900
very strange ways.

844
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,040
But I think it's more than
just an intellectual blind

845
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,560
spot, I think it's also a
psychological blind spot

846
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,370
where we find ourselves, you
know, very attracted to

847
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,810
competition in one form or
another.

848
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,600
We find it reassuring if
other people do things.

849
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,590
The word ape, already in the
time of Shakespeare,

850
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,720
meant both primate and
imitate.

851
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,330
And there is

852
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,340
something about human nature
that's deeply mimetic.

853
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,690
Imitative.

854
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,600
Apelike, sheeplike,
lemminglike, herdlike.

855
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,755
And it's this very
problematic thing that we
