286
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,330
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo
That they don't know what to
do with it

287
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,308
beyond a certain point.

288
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:28,490
And so let me

289
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,200
say a few things about how
to build a monopoly.

290
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,767
And, I think one of the sort
of very counter

291
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:42,420
intuitive ideas that comes
out of this monopoly thread.

292
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,290
Is that you want to go after
small markets.

293
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,170
If you're a startup.

294
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,670
You want to get to monopoly.

295
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,040
You're starting a new
company,

296
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,150
you want to get to monopoly.

297
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,910
Monopolies you have a large
share of a market,

298
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,710
how do you get to a large
share of a market?

299
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,190
You start with a really
small market and

300
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,720
you take over that whole
market, and then.

301
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,070
And then over time you find
ways to expand that market

302
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,080
in concentric circles.

303
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,190
And the thing that's always
a big mistake is going

304
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,730
after a giant market on day
one.

305
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,800
Because that's typically
evidence that you

306
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,650
somehow haven't defined the
categories correctly.

307
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,790
And it normally means that
there is going to be

308
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,260
too much competition.

309
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,490
In one way or another.

310
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,340
And so I think almost all
the successful companies

311
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,620
in Silicon Valley had some
model of

312
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,760
starting with small markets
and expanding.

313
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,740
And if you take Amazon, you
start with.

314
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,870
Just a bookstore.

315
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,450
We have all the books in the
world.

316
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,580
So it's a better bookstore
than anybody else

317
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,360
has in the world.

318
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,130
When it's starts in the
90's, it's online,

319
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,130
there's things you can do
you can't do before.

320
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,145
And then you gradually
expand into all sorts of

321
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,465
different forms of
e-commerce and

322
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,252
other things beyond that.

323
00:15:01,252 --> 00:15:04,816
You know, eBay you start
with Pez dispensers.

324
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,986
You move on to Beanie Babies
and

325
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,574
eventually it's all these
different auctions for

326
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:13,740
all these sorts of different
goods.

327
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,810
And what was very counter
intuitive about many of

328
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,700
these companies is they
often start with

329
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,560
markets that are so small
that people don't think

330
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,020
that they're valuable at all
when you get started.

331
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,370
The PayPal version of this
was, we started with

332
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,730
power sellers on eBay which
was about 20,000 people.

333
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,480
When we first saw this
happening in December of 99,

334
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,250
January of 2000 right after
we launched,

335
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,130
there was a sense that these
were all,

336
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,610
it was such a small market
it was terrible.

337
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,860
We thought these were
terrible customers to have.

338
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,010
It's just people selling
junk on the internet.

339
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,960
Why in the world do we want
to

340
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,800
be going after this market?

341
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,920
But, you know, there was a
way to get a product that

342
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,040
was much better for
everybody in that market.

343
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,060
You could, and we got to
something like 25, 30%,

344
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,510
you know, market penetration
in two or three months.

345
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,700
And you got some walk in.

346
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,130
You got brand recognition
and

347
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,300
your able to build the
business from there.

348
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,850
So I always think these,

349
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,220
these very small markets are
quite underrated.

350
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,550
The Facebook version of this
I always give is that you

351
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,700
know if the initial market
of

352
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,150
Facebook was 10,000 people
at Harvard, it went from

353
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,910
zero to sixty percent market
share in ten days.

354
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,020
That was a very auspicious
start.

355
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,246
The way this gets analyzed
in business schools is

356
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:35,711
always, that's ridiculous,

357
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,330
it's such a small market it
can't have any value at all.

358
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,230
And so, I think the business
school analysis of

359
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,900
Facebook early on, or of
PayPal early on, or

360
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,240
of eBay early on is that the
markets were perhaps, so

361
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,820
small as to have, almost no
value.

362
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,620
And they, they would have
had little value had

363
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,450
they stayed small, but it
turned out they were ways to

364
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,230
grow them concentrically
and, that's what made them,

365
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,260
that's what made them so
valuable.

366
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,730
Now I think the opposite
version of this,

367
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,890
is always where you have
super big markets.

368
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,910
And, and I, there's so much,

369
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,650
so many different things
that went wrong with all

370
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,670
the clean tech companies in
the last decade.

371
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,740
But, but, one,

372
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,620
one theme that ran through
almost all of them,

373
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,070
was that they all started
with massive markets.

374
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,850
And every clean tech
PowerPoint presentation that

375
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,900
one saw in the years 2005 to
2008,

376
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,830
which was the clean tech
bubble in Silicon Valley.

377
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,330
Started with, we're in the
energy market,

378
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,070
we're in a market that's
measured in hundreds of

379
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,510
billions of trillions of
dollars.

380
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,180
And then once you're a
minnow in a vast ocean.

381
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,860
That's not a good place to
be.

382
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,440
That means that you have
tons of competitors and

383
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,080
you don't even know who all
the competitors are.

384
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,930
And so you want to be a one
of a kind company,

385
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,740
where it's the only one in a
small ecosystem.

386
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,300
You don't want to

387
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,750
be the fourth online pet
food company.

388
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,330
You don't want to be

389
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,780
the tenth thin film solar
panel company.

390
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,322
You don't want to be the
100th restaurant in

391
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:04,300
Palo Alto.

392
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,550
Your restaurant industry is
a trillion dollar industry,

393
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,140
so if you do a market size
analysis you conclude

394
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,730
restaurants are a fantastic
business to go into, and

395
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,580
it's often, large markets,
large existing markets

396
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,180
typically mean that you have
tons of competition, very,

397
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,160
very hard to differentiate.

398
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,780
So the first very
counterintuitive into a idea

399
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,000
is to go after small
markets, often markets that

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,380
are so small people don't
even notice them.

401
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,200
They don't think that they
make sense.

402
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,900
That's where you got a
foothold, and

403
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,380
then if those markets are
able to expand,

404
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,740
you can scale into a big
monopoly business.

405
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,260
You know, a second sort of,
the sort of several

406
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,890
different characteristics of
these monopoly businesses,

407
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,480
that I like to focus on.

408
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,670
There's probably no sort of
single formula to it.

409
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,130
I also ways think that that
in technology there

410
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,470
is always a sense that you
know,

411
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,800
the history of technology is
such that every.

412
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,670
Every moment happens only
once, so you know the next

413
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,110
Mark Zuckerberg won't build
a social network.

414
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,800
The next Larry Page won't be
building a search engine.

415
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
The next Bill Gates won't be

416
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,750
building an operating
system.

417
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,402
And if you're copying these
people,

418
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:18,450
you're not learning from
them.

419
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,950
But it's, and so,

420
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,600
there is always these very
unique businesses that

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,930
are doing something that's
not been done before,

422
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,320
end up, end of having the
potential to be a monopoly.

423
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,330
The opening line in Anna
Karenina that all

424
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,770
happy companies, sorry, all
happy families.

425
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,760
All happy families are
alike.

426
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,490
All unhappy families are
unhappy in

427
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,000
their own special way.

428
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,550
And the opposite is true in
business,

429
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,180
where I think all happy
companies are different

430
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,510
because they're doing
something very unique.

431
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,470
All unhappy companies are
alike because they fail to

432
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,330
escape the essential
sameness that

433
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,100
is competition, and so

434
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,410
one sort of characteristic
of a monopoly technology

435
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,500
company is some sort of
proprietary technology.

436
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,680
My sort of crazy, somewhat
arbitrary,

437
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,940
rule of thumb is you want to
have a technology that's

438
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,210
an order of magnitude better
than the next best thing.

439
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,460
So Amazon had over ten times
as many books,

440
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,300
maybe not that high tech,
but you figure out a way to

441
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,030
sell ten times as many books
in an efficient online way.

442
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,630
You know, PayPal, the
alternative for

443
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,160
PayPal was using checks to
send money on eBay,

444
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,590
took seven to ten days to
clear.

445
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,560
PayPal could do it more than
ten times as fast.

446
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,770
So you wanna have some sort
of very

447
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,360
powerful improvement in some
order, maybe an order of

448
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,150
magnitude improvement on
some key dimension.

449
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,940
Of course, you know,

450
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,030
if you actually come with
something totally new it's,

451
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,200
it's just, it's just like an
infinite improvement.

452
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,990
So I would say the,

453
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,820
the iPhone was the first
smartphone that worked and

454
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,530
so that's, you know that's
like I mean,

455
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,690
I mean maybe not infinite,
but

456
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,150
it's sort of definitely
order of magnitude or

457
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,190
more of improvement.

458
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,030
So I think, the, the
technology is designed to

459
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,880
give you a massive delta
over, over the next,

460
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,950
the next best thing.

461
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,580
I think, I think there often
are network effects that

462
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,820
can kick in that, really
help.

463
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,430
The thing that's very, and
these,

464
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,720
these lead to monopolies
over time,

465
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,800
the thing that's very tricky
about network effects is,

466
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,740
they're often.

467
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,440
They're often very hard to
get started.

468
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,370
So even though everyone
understands how

469
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,880
valuable they are, there is

470
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,400
always this incredibly
tricky question why is it

471
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,660
valuable to the first person
who is doing something?

472
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,860
Economies of scale, if you
have something of

473
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,720
a very high fixed costs,
very low marginal cost.

474
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,520
That's typically a monopoly
like business.

475
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,110
And then there's this thing
of branding.

476
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,220
Which is sort of like this
idea that gets lodged in

477
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,420
people's brains.

478
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,700
I never quite understand how
branding works, so I never

479
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,920
invest in companies where
it's just about branding.

480
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,670
But it is, I think,

481
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,320
a real phenomenon that
creates real value.

482
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,330
I think one of the things,
I'm gonna come back to

483
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,990
this a little bit, towards
the end.

484
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,410
But one of the things that's
very striking,

485
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,190
is that software businesses
are often, are, for

486
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,980
some reason, very good at
some of these things.

487
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,660
They're especially good at
the economies of scale part.

488
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,290
Because, the marginal cost
of software is zero.

489
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,860
And so if you get something
that works in software.

490
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,080
It's often significantly
better

491
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,350
than the existing solution.

492
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,210
And then you have these
tremendous economies of

493
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,500
scale, and you can scale
fairly quickly.

494
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,640
So even if the market starts
small,

495
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,940
you can grow your business
quickly enough to stay at

496
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,350
the same size as the growing
market.

497
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,190
And maintain the sort of
monopoly power.

498
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,880
Now, the critical thing
about these monopolies is,

499
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,370
it's not enough to have a
monopoly for just a moment.

500
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,320
The critical thing is to

501
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,130
have one that lasts over
time.

502
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,120
And so in Silicon Valley
there's always this idea

503
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
that you wanna be the first
mover.

504
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,260
And I, I always think it's,
it's, in some ways,

505
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,670
the better framing is you
wanna be the last mover, or

506
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,000
you wanna be the last
company in a category.

507
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,430
Those are the ones that are
really valid.

508
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,760
Microsoft was the last
operating system,

509
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,430
at least for many decades.

510
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,650
Google is the last search
engine.

511
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,140
Facebook will be valuable if
it turns out to be the last,

512
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,010
social networking site.

513
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,760
One way to think of

514
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,950
this last mover of value is
this idea that most of

515
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,890
the value in these companies
exists far in the future.

516
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,770
If you do a discounted cash
flow analysis of a business.

517
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,160
You look at, you have sort
of all these profit streams.

518
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,360
You have a growth rate.

519
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
The growth rate's much
higher than

520
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,880
the discount rate.

521
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,900
And so most of the value
exists far in the future.

522
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,783
I did this exercise At
PayPal in March of 2001.

523
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:55,110
We'd been in business for
about 27 months.

524
00:23:56,345 --> 00:24:00,660
And we sort of had, the
growth rate was 100% a year.

525
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,890
We were discounting future
cashflows by about 30%.

526
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,460
And it turned out that about
three quarters of

527
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,310
the value of the business,
as of 2001,

528
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,180
came from cash flows in
years 2011 and beyond.

529
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,260
And whenever you do the math
on any of these tech

530
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,840
companies, you get an answer
that's something like that.

531
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,020
So if you are trying to
analyze any other

532
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,170
tech companies in Silicon
Valley, Arabian B, Twitter.

533
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,390
Facebook, any emerging
internet companies,

534
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,570
any of the ones in
Y-Combinator.

535
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,215
The math tells you that
three quarters, 80,

536
00:24:33,215 --> 00:24:36,620
85% of the value is coming
from cash flows in

537
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,780
years 2024 and beyond.

538
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,910
It's very, very far in the
future.

539
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,010
And, so one of the things
that we always overvalue in

540
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,570
Silicon Valley is growth
rates, and

541
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,730
we undervalue durability.

542
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,300
Because, growth is something
you can measure in the here

543
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,040
and now, and you can always
track that very precisely.

544
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,240
The question of whether a
company's still gonna be

545
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,070
around a decade from now.

546
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,300
That's actually what,

547
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,520
what dominates the value
equation and

548
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,510
that sort of is a much more
qualitative sort of a thing.

549
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,570
And so if we, if we went
back to this idea of these

550
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,700
characteristics of monopoly,
proprietary technology,

551
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,360
network effects, economies
of scale, You can think

552
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,270
of these characteristics as
ones that exist at a moment

553
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,190
in time when you capture a
market and take it over.

554
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,880
But you also want to think
about,

555
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,370
are these things going to
last over time.

556
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,350
And, so, there's a time

557
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,440
dimension to all these
characteristics.

558
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,030
So, net worth effects also
have a great time element,

559
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,010
where as the network scales
the network

560
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,750
effects actually get more
robust, and so

561
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,430
if you have a network effect
business that's often one

562
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:46,120
that can become a bigger and
stronger monopoly over time.

563
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,710
Proprietary technology is
always a little bit of

564
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,520
a tricky one, so

565
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,180
you want something that's
order magnitude better.

566
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,620
Than, the state of the art
in the world today.

567
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,890
And that's how you get
people's attention.

568
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,900
That's how you initially
break through.

569
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,960
But then, you don't wanna be
superseded by somebody else.

570
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,580
And so there are all these
areas of innovation where,
