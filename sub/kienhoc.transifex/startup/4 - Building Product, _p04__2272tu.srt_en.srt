850
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,800
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP176MBG9Tk
strategies to increase this
curve,

851
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,160
like keep making it go up
and up and

852
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:37,170
up, you want to basically
look at this analysis,

853
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,580
over time to see if that
strategy is working for you.

854
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,358
Okay, does that make sense?

855
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,850
Okay, cool.

856
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,188
The second kind of growth is
viral growth and like sticky

857
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:55,169
growth you need to also
deliver a good experience.

858
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,379
But on top of that you need
to deliver a really,

859
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,989
really good experience,
like, what's going to make

860
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,598
these people shout out loud
on Twitter, on Facebook or

861
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:04,470
whatever and tell all their
friends and

862
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,107
email all their friends and
family members about you.

863
00:39:07,107 --> 00:39:08,980
You have to really deliver a
good experience.

864
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,120
Combined with that is, u
need to have really good

865
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,780
mechanics for the referral
program itself, like,

866
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,800
you have a hundred customers
who really wanna talk

867
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,950
about you now, how are they
going to talk about you?

868
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,960
So, in that sense a viral
growth,

869
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,090
the viral growth strategy is
all really about one

870
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,130
building good experience,
but if you have that,

871
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,900
it's how do you build a good
referral program.

872
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,390
And so I've listed the three
main parts of that.

873
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,727
One is the customer touch
points, which is,

874
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:41,660
where are people,

875
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,280
learning that they can refer
other people.

876
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,180
So, that might be just,
after they book, or

877
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,882
after they sign up there is
a,

878
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:51,600
usually you see these like,
right after you sign up for,

879
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,555
for whatever reason most,
for whatever reason most

880
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,900
people just immediately tell
you to invite other friends,

881
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,260
even though you've never
used the product before.

882
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,571
And so, but that's a
customer touch point,

883
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:00,510
is just right after you sign
up.

884
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,660
A better one is after they
use the product after

885
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,280
a while, and you see that
they're highly engaged,

886
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,490
then to show them that link
and

887
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,630
get them to send it out to
everyone.

888
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,140
Another one is if

889
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,780
you're doing more of a
platform type play like, for

890
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,870
Homejoy we actually go
inside their homes.

891
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,310
So now, the customer touch
point is when the cleaning

892
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,340
professional is inside the
home,

893
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,830
they can have a leave
behind,

894
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,220
and, we can show them
something there too as well.

895
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,930
so, you wanna basically put
the customer touch points

896
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,930
and put the actual, link or
whatever it is, how they're

897
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,320
gonna refer all their
friends at a point in time

898
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,440
when they're highly engaged
and they're loving you.

899
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,390
Second is program mechanics.

900
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,290
And so that's where, like,
the most common thing that

901
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,558
I've seen is $10 for $10,
that is, you get $10 if you

902
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:50,440
invite your friend and they
use it and they get $10.

903
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,050
And so, you should try
different types of

904
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,330
mechanics in that sense and

905
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,010
try to optimize for whatever
works for you.

906
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,280
You know, it could be 25 for
25,

907
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,370
it could be ten for zero, it
could many of these things.

908
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:06,400
And lastly it's when the,
when your friend clicks on

909
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,680
the link, on your referral
link, when they come back to

910
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,720
the site, it's very
important to really optimize

911
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,110
that conversion flow of how
they're going to sign up.

912
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,390
And so sometimes you need to
just sell them in

913
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,390
a different manner, or
upsell that their friend has

914
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,560
suggested they use this and
so on and so forth.

915
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,790
So, all these combined, you
need to really play

916
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,470
around with these on
different dimensions and

917
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,640
come up with a good referral
program.

918
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,670
And, lastly, it's paid
growth, so,

919
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,990
examples of paid growth is
this right here.

920
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,580
And these are the most
obvious ones, but

921
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,860
I'm sure you guys can think
of more.

922
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,890
And paid growth is
basically,

923
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,690
you happen to have money,
you can spend.

924
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,580
You might have credit cards,
whatever, but

925
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,789
you can spend something to
get users.

926
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,300
So, the correct way to think
about pay to growth is that,

927
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,240
okay you're going to put
money.

928
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,504
You're gonna risk putting
money out there,

929
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:07,920
what are you gonna get in
return?

930
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,930
The simple way to think
about it is, is your CLV,

931
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,670
your customer lifetime, the
amount of money,

932
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,750
the net revenue, the amount
of money that people,

933
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,120
that your customer returns
back to you,

934
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,790
is it more than your CAC?

935
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,770
And your CAC is an
abbreviation for

936
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,100
customer acquisition cost.

937
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:32,710
So, an example is, you pay,
actually the slide

938
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,260
here has an example here, so
say you run a bunch of ads.

939
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,950
These are four ads.

940
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,280
Over 12 months,

941
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,440
the customer's worth $300 to
you.

942
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,050
Each one of these ads, when
you click on it,

943
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,770
the CPC costs different
types of money.

944
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,370
And then, when they click on
the ad, then they have to

945
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,000
come to your site and sign
up or buy something, and

946
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,632
the conversion rates are
different for all these ads.

947
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:04,650
And then, the CAC is
calculated simply by

948
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,320
the CPC divided by the
conversion.

949
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,740
And so, you see that there's

950
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,110
different acquisition costs
for different types of ads.

951
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,530
And to determine whether,
that is a good ad or

952
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,150
a bad ad, all you have to do
is, CLV minus CAC.

953
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,030
Is it more than zero?

954
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,860
If it's at zero then you've,
that's fine, but

955
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,790
hopefully it's actually more

956
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,840
than zero until you actually
are earning a profit on it.

957
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,670
So, we see that, despite the
sales remaining the same and

958
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,670
the conversions being higher
and lower,

959
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,810
there's sometimes, some ads
that might seem good,

960
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,020
actually don't seem so good
at the end of the day.

961
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,380
Now, the advanced way of
looking at it is you can

962
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,790
look at this for your whole
entire customer base for

963
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,740
aggregating all your
customers together.

964
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,990
But the better way of

965
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,955
looking at it is to break it
down by customer segments.

966
00:43:54,955 --> 00:44:01,490
So, if you have for example,
if you're building

967
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,530
a marketplace, I don't know,
for country music,

968
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,550
the CLV's of someone in
Nashville Tennessee is going

969
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,478
to be much larger than the
CLV's and

970
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:13,820
latent value of someone in
Czechoslovakia.

971
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,000
So, or, I just assume that's
the case anyway.

972
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,680
So, you'll need to, you want
to make sure that when

973
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,740
you're buying ads for these
different types of cohorts,

974
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,610
or these types of customer
segments,

975
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,320
that you know what the
differences are.

976
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,210
You don't wanna mix like,
everything together.

977
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,880
So, the last one on payback
time is sustainability.

978
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,233
I think a lot of businesses
get in trouble, and

979
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:48,173
it turns into a bad business
when they start

980
00:44:48,173 --> 00:44:50,307
spending beyond their means.

981
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:54,303
And it has a lot to do with
risk tolerance, or

982
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:58,085
how much risk you're willing
to take on.

983
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:01,688
So, when you look at CLV's
of these.

984
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:05,626
Let's just suppose you get a
customer a customer who's

985
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:08,809
worth $300 after 12 months,
that is,

986
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:12,020
in the first month they're
worth $100.

987
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,800
If you wait til the end of
the 12 month period,

988
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,870
then they give you the other
$200.

989
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:21,615
But if, in the first period
you're actually paying

990
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:26,434
$200 for them, then you're
in the whole for

991
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:29,740
$100 until the end of the 12
month period.

992
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,180
And that's when you start
getting into

993
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,319
potentially unsustainable
growth, which is

994
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,320
something could happen where
at the end of the 12 months,

995
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,320
you don't actually get the
$200 from the customer, and

996
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,270
you end up in a very bad
situation and

997
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,080
essentially just at the end
of the day,

998
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,100
you could be running out of
money.

999
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,290
And if you're doing this
with credit cards,

1000
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:58,930
you will definitely find
that you're gonna have to,

1001
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,610
you know, declare bankruptcy
very soon.

1002
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,990
So again, payback time is
very important, a safe one

1003
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,810
to go with is 3 months if
you have very high risk,

1004
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,780
if you're very risk loving,
maybe 12 months is better.

1005
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,990
Beyond 12 months is very
much an unsafe territory.

1006
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,068
How much time do I have?

1007
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:29,160
A minute, okay.

1008
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,210
So, I'll just go into this,
the art of pivoting.

1009
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,150
So a lot of people ask me,
Homejoy went through,

1010
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,460
Homejoy in its current
concept is

1011
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,050
literally the thirteenth
idea we fully built out and

1012
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,530
try and execute on and try
to get customers for.

1013
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,740
And so, a lot of the
questions I get

1014
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,300
is how did you even, like,
get to that thirteenth idea?

1015
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,850
And how'd you decide when to
move on.

1016
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,850
And so the best guidance I
can give on that is,

1017
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:04,570
to kind of look at these
three criteria, which is,

1018
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,630
once you realize you can't
grow, or once you realize,

1019
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:13,420
you are despite building out
all these great features and

1020
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,190
talking to all these users.

1021
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,010
None of them stick, or you
don't

1022
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,010
have any good high retaining
users, or the economics of

1023
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,900
the business just doesn't
make sense, then once you

1024
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,920
make that realization, you
just need to move on.

1025
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,410
And I think the trickiest
one is probably the growth

1026
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:31,760
one, because there's so many
stories out there

1027
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,540
where the founder stuck with
the idea, and then,

1028
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,610
after three years, all of a
sudden it started growing.

1029
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,550
So, the trick here is
basically,

1030
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:42,690
what you really should do
is,

1031
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,932
you should have a growth
plan when you start out,

1032
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:51,410
which is you should ideally
just have, what is

1033
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,300
an optimistic but realistic
way to grow this business?

1034
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,190
And so, it might look
something like this.

1035
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,223
And this is T and this is
number of users.

1036
00:48:04,223 --> 00:48:11,870
So, in week one you want,
you just want one user.

1037
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,680
In week two you want maybe
two users and

1038
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,390
so and so forth.

1039
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,040
And you can keep doubling up
and up.

1040
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,470
So, in week one you should
basically do

1041
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,400
as much as possible,

1042
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,300
build whatever you have to
build to get that one user.

1043
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,810
And then in week two, so on,
so forth, you build whatever

1044
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,600
you need to get two users,
four users, eight users.

1045
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,560
In the beginning it should
be fairly, if you

1046
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,310
have a product that people
actually wan,t you should be

1047
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,600
able to maintain this growth
curve pretty easily just by

1048
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,210
walking around and manually
finding people.

1049
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,840
It's when you get to like,
you need 100 users a week,

1050
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,240
or you need some of these
more,

1051
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,120
you need the growth
strategies to start working.

1052
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,160
And so, what I tell people
is usually if you're fully

1053
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,139
executing on your product,
and you're really

1054
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:58,639
working really, really hard,
then, if you go three or

1055
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,916
four weeks in a row of no
growth, backwards growth,

1056
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:05,490
then either, then it's time
to maybe consider a pivot,

1057
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,245
in the sense that not
starting over, like,

1058
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,360
completely come with a new
idea.

1059
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,831
But you're probably
fundamentally doing

1060
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:13,584
something wrong, because, in
that early stage of

1061
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,070
a start up, you should
always be growing.

1062
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,170
And, so, it's not.

1063
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,320
And this is optimistically
what it looks like.

1064
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,390
And this is like, kind of
the growth curve I set forth

1065
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,730
and put out when I started
Home Joy.

1066
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,520
But really what it looks
like is like this.

1067
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,720
And so you wanna make sure
that when you're in

1068
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,980
a low like over here, that
you don't just stop, right?

1069
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,440
And that's why you should
wait two to three weeks,as

1070
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,090
long as you keep working
hard, you'll eventually get

1071
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,663
back here and you'll see a
trend like this over time.

1072
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:50,741
Cool, so that's pivoting

1073
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:54,790
and that's it.

1074
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,528
I can take questions at this
point.

1075
00:49:56,528 --> 00:50:04,010
>> Answer one question.

1076
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:04,720
>> Yeah.
One question?

1077
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,200
>> So one question online
was, if your users have a

1078
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,110
product that they're already
somewhat comfortable with,

1079
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:11,760
how do you get them to
switch to your's?

1080
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,420
>> Right so, there's a
switch over costs.

1081
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,850
I'll tell you the example of
Homejoy.

1082
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,830
So, Homejoy,

1083
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,760
we actually were creating a
new market in the sense that

1084
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,320
a lot of our initial users
never had cleaning before.

1085
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,290
So, it was pretty simple to
get them on board.

1086
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,860
And a lot of people who have
cleaners already,

1087
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,660
really trust their cleaner
and they will.

1088
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,670
To get them to come and use
something else is actually,

1089
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,440
probably the most difficult
task in the world.

1090
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,920
And so, when you're billing
things and trying to

1091
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,860
get people to switch over to
you, what you really need to

1092
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,260
do is find the moments where
your product or

1093
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,590
what your offering is much
better or very

1094
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,600
much differentiated from the
existing solution they have.

1095
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,360
So, an example is someone
who had a regular cleaner

1096
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,070
and maybe they had a party
one day and

1097
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,770
they needed a cleaning
almost the next day.

1098
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,250
And because Homejoy,

1099
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,140
in most of the areas has
next day availability,

1100
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,010
they would just come to
Homejoy and use it, because

1101
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,990
they knew they couldn't get
their regular cleaner.

1102
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,880
And once they start using
the product,

1103
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,230
then that's when they start
realizing the advantage,

1104
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,740
the little advantages of
using Homejoy which adds up

1105
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,460
to a big advantage.

1106
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,912
So, a lot of things are,

1107
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:26,250
realizing that, leaving cash
out, or

1108
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,180
leaving checks was really
annoying, and so billing

1109
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,180
through online payments was
more convenient.

1110
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,930
Being able to book, cancel,
and reschedule, according to

1111
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,990
your own schedule was very
convenient and so

1112
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,526
and so forth.

1113
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:41,660
And so, it's just, it's
really hard to,

1114
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,370
a lot of people when they
build the product,

1115
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,910
they're like, and these 50
things are better than,

1116
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,150
a little bit better than,
the existing solution.

1117
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,510
It's really hard, even if
the benefits outweigh

1118
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,500
the switch-over costs.

1119
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:58,190
It's really hard to actually
tell that to a user and

1120
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,420
try to get them to aggregate
all those benefits over many

1121
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:02,960
little things.

1122
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,000
It's better to just have one
or two things that clearly

1123
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,380
differentiate yourself from
the product so.

1124
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,270
>> Thank you very much.

1125
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:10,770
>> Yeah.

1126
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,155
>> That was awesome.

1127
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:18,745
>> Yeah?

1128
00:52:18,745 --> 00:52:21,590
Okay.
