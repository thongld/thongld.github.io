1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,620
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs
So I'm going to talk about how
to operate.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,740
So I've watched some of the
prior classes, and

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,470
I'm going to assume that
you've already sort of

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,590
hired a bunch of horrendously
resourceful people.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,570
That you've built a product
that at

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,300
least some people love.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,260
And you're probably raised
some capital.

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,660
And now you're trying to build
a company.

9
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,420
So you're, you're enforging a
product and

10
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,800
now you have to forge a
company.

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,650
And it actually argue for

12
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,100
GM company is much more
difficult than for

13
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,170
a GM product.

14
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,720
Basic reason is people are
irrational.

15
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,260
So you probably all know this
either your parents,

16
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,170
your significant other or your
brother or sister, or

17
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,490
your teacher, somebody in your
life is irrational.

18
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,890
Building a company is
basically taking all

19
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,740
the irrational people you
know, putting them in one

20
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,830
building and then living with
them 12 hours a day at least.

21
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,930
So, it's very challenging.

22
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,520
Now, there's techniques for
coping with that and

23
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,640
some people get good at it and
small people don't but

24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,289
that's where really what
operating is about.

25
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,963
So basically what you're doing
when you build a company is

26
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:45,179
you're building an engine.

27
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,166
And at first you have a
drawing literally on a white

28
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,868
board, and you're architecting
it, and it

29
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:54,655
looks very conceptually clean,
and beautiful, and pretty.

30
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,264
But when you start actually
translating to

31
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,052
practice actually it looks
more like this, and

32
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,760
you're holding it together
with duct tape.

33
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,812
And it takes a lot of heroic
effort to people to

34
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,110
actually hold it together.

35
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,100
That's why people work 80, 100
hours a week,

36
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,820
is that heroic effort is
actually necessary to keep

37
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,610
this thing together.

38
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,330
Because you don't actually yet
have polished metal in place.

39
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,850
Eventually you

40
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,880
want to construct a high
performance machine.

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,370
A machine that actually almost
nobody really has to

42
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,850
worry about every hour.

43
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,330
Every minute and you know as
we

44
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,430
used to joke about Ebay that
if Martians took over Ebay it

45
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,470
would take like six months for
the world to notice.

46
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,290
That's what eventually what
you want to get to.

47
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,510
Or as Warren Buffet says, you
know, build a company that

48
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,490
idiots could run because
eventually they will.

49
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,010
So this is what you want
basically a performance

50
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,069
machine that idiots can run.

51
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,190
Now, as a leader, what is your
real job?

52
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,268
What's your role?

53
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,360
Strictly speaking there's only
one book that's ever written

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,339
that actually explains how to
do this, it's a little old.

55
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,196
It was written in 1992 by Andy
Grove,

56
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,266
who's quite famous, quite
successful, and

57
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,857
his definition of what your
job is,

58
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,928
is to maximize the output of
an organization,

59
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,530
your organization that you're
responsible for, CEOs,

60
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,630
everything and a VP would be
part of the organization.

61
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,810
And the organizations around
you, so if you're VPE,

62
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,790
you're actually are
responsible for

63
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,320
the performance of the product
team too, or

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,760
the marketing team, because
you have influence there.

65
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,110
So this is how measure people
and you want to focus on

66
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,390
the output not the input the
old adage about measuring,

67
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,780
not measuring motion and
confusing that will progress,

68
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,950
you're measuring only
progress.

69
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,310
And this is going to sound
like a fancy and

70
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,300
glamorous thing to do.

71
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,330
Maybe people get excited about
managing a whole

72
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,390
large organization, and being
responsible for the output.

73
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,450
But in practice, what you're
going to learn today hopefully

74
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,240
is that it's more about things
like ordering smoothies,

75
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,850
teaching your receptionist how
to answer the phone properly,

76
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,060
and serving as a $10 an hour
task rabbit for

77
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,050
your employees.

78
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,230
So let's talk about that.

79
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,080
So at first when you

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,630
start a company everything's
going to feel like a mess.

81
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,950
And it really should if you
have too much process,

82
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,760
too much predictability you're
probably not

83
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,550
innovating fast enough and
creatively enough.

84
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,550
So it should feel like
everyday there's a new

85
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,300
problem and what you're doing
is fundamentally triaging.

86
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,360
So some things will look like
a problem, and

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,750
they're actually a colds,
they're just going to go away.

88
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,620
So, somebody's annoyed about
this or that.

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,570
That may be a cold, and you
shouldn't stress about it,

90
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,900
and you certainly shouldn't
allocated a lot of

91
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,420
your time to it.

92
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,400
And some things are going to
present themselves as colds.

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,515
But just like in the emergency
room, if they're not

94
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,693
diagnosed properly they
actually can become fatal.

95
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,489
So what I'm going to try to do
is help give you

96
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,823
frameworks for thinking about
which things are colds and

97
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,390
which things are potentially
fatal.

98
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,680
So one of the most important
things I've learned at

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
Square is actually a concept
of editing.

100
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,960
And this is the,

101
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,600
I think the best metaphor I've
ever seen in like 14 years of

102
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,470
running stuff of how to think
about your job.

103
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,290
It's natural, it's a natural
metaphor so

104
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,680
it's easy to take with you
every day.

105
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
And actually it's easy to
transmit to each of

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,910
your employees so that they
can figure out

107
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,510
wether they are editing or
writing.

108
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,720
It's a natural construct.

109
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,360
You generally know when
someone asks you to

110
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,220
do something.

111
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,850
Am I more writing or am I more
editing?

112
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,490
So an editor, as, is the best
metaphor for your job,

113
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,150
and we're talking about the
specific things you're doing

114
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,620
in editing.

115
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,010
The first thing an editor
does, and

116
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,950
you probably all had this
experience in school,

117
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,630
is you submit a paper to a TA,
a draft to your friend.

118
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,860
And the first thing an editor
does is

119
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,970
they take out a red pen or
nowadays, you know online, and

120
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,570
they start striking things.

121
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,750
Basically eliminating things.

122
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,090
The most important task as an
editor is to simplify,

123
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,630
simplify, and that usually
means omitting things.

124
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,590
So that's your job too, is to
clarify and simplify for

125
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,810
everybody on your team,

126
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,940
the more you simplify the
better people will perform.

127
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,610
People cannot understand and

128
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,910
keep track of a complicated
set of initiatives.

129
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,230
So you've got to distill it
down to one, two, or

130
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,270
three things.

131
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,610
And use a framework that they
can repeat,

132
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,310
they can repeat without
thinking about,

133
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,630
they can repeat to their
friends,

134
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,480
they can repeat at night.

135
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,580
Don't except the excuse of
complexity.

136
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,240
A lot of people will tell you
that well this is

137
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,590
too challenging, this is too
complicated.

138
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,380
Well yeah, I know other people
simplify but

139
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,150
that's not for me.

140
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,950
This is a complicated
business.

141
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,930
They're wrong.

142
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,085
You can change the world, in
140 characters.

143
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,911
You can build the most
important companies in

144
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:53,910
history in a very simple to
describe concept.

145
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,970
You can market products in
less than about 50 characters.

146
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,100
There's no reason why you

147
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,820
can't build your company the
same way.

148
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,520
So force yourself to simplify
every initiative,

149
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,630
every product, every
marketing, every,

150
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,960
everything you do.

151
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,790
And, and basically take out
that red,

152
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,430
and start eliminating stuff.

153
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,700
Second thing is, what editors
do,

154
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,560
is they ask you clarifying
questions.

155
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,950
So when you present a paper to
somebody,

156
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,720
what do they usually do?

157
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Do they, find some ambiguity
somewhere and

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,650
they say, well did you really
mean this, do you mean that,

159
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,990
do you have an example of
this?

160
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,190
That's what your job is, so
you're in a meeting and

161
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,360
people are going to look to
you, and the real thing you

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,780
do is you actually ask a lot
of questions.

163
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,630
And they can be simple, basic
questions like,

164
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,660
should we try this seven days
a week or six days?

165
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,200
They can be fundamental
questions like,

166
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,330
where's our competitive
advantage here?

167
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,160
We try to this actually as
investors too

168
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,750
some investors will ask you a
billion questions about

169
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,560
a billion things and they'll
have you do diligence forever.

170
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,110
We try to narrow it down to
what are one, two or

171
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,650
three four things that
actually matter for

172
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,070
this company and only focus on
those things.

173
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,660
So it allows us to be more
decisive, and

174
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,100
we can make decisions rapidly.

175
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,090
It allows us not to distract
you from your day job,

176
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,920
which is actually building a
company.

177
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,035
And yet, I think we still get
to the higher fide,

178
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,280
highest fidelity answers.

179
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,320
We don't have all these extra,

180
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,340
extraneous details, pieces of
data.

181
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,850
Now it's hard, it's something
you have to practice, but

182
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,810
when you're good at it, every
step you eliminate, Andy Grove

183
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,560
estimated that you can improve
performance by 30-50%.

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,830
The next thing you do is
allocate resources.

185
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,110
So the editing construct,

186
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,890
this is what editors do all
the time.

187
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,160
They take editors from the
mid-East and

188
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,480
covering the mid-East and they
move them to Silicon Valley,

189
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,840
because Silicon Valley is now,
now more interesting.

190
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,510
Or they move them to a sports
section because they want to

191
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,680
compete on the basis of sports
with other journals and

192
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,370
other publications.

193
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,650
So that can be top down where
I take a bunch of,

194
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,710
allocate resources and

195
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,360
people would say, we're now
going over here,

196
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,910
we're going to compete on this
basis.

197
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,060
And then next month, next
quarter, next year,

198
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,650
I'm like well,

199
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,780
that Middle East coverage is
getting boring and bland.

200
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,930
We don't want to do that
anymore.

201
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,250
Let's go chase after something
else, or it can be bottom up,

202
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,920
just like journalists mostly
come up

203
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,840
with their own stories, the
people who work with you.

204
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,260
Generally should be coming up
with their own initiatives.

205
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,231
So, a reporter will generally,
who covers Google, come up

206
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:04,913
with the interesting stories
that they're hearing in

207
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:07,961
aether, and propose one or two
to their editor for approval.

208
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,994
But it's not like the editor
is saying, go cover Google,

209
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:10,998
and this is the angle I want.

210
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,227
Once in a while they do that,
but

211
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:13,915
that's not the date, the day,
the meat and

212
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,520
potatoes of what a journalist
does every day.

213
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,500
Your goal over time is to
actually use less red

214
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,650
ink every day.

215
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,474
So one way of measuring how
well you're doing in

216
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,158
communicating to

217
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:25,446
your colleagues about what's
important and what's not.

218
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,119
What, why some things are
important,

219
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,031
some things are not,

220
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,470
is how much red ink you're
pulling out every day.

221
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,930
It's okay if you have a bad
day and

222
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,490
the red inks all over the
place.

223
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,970
But it's not okay if the red
ink next month is

224
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,350
more is more than it was last
month,

225
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,820
if the next quarter is more
than this.

226
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,380
So measure yourself of how
much red ink you're creating.

227
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,450
The other thing that's very
important that actually isn't

228
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,380
as intuitive to a lot of
people is,

229
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,140
the job of an editor is to
ensure consistent voice.

230
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,880
So if any of you read The
Economist,

231
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,460
you can tell that there's one
consistent voice.

232
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,250
You can pick up any article,
any post in The Economist, and

233
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,360
if feels like it's written by
the same person.

234
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,980
Ideally your company should
feel like,

235
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,480
on your website and your PR
release,

236
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,700
on your packaging, if it's a
physical product.

237
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,810
Anywhere on your recruiting
pages to feel like it

238
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,110
was written by one person.

239
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,570
That's extremely difficult to
do,

240
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,300
and first you're going to be
tempted to do

241
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,390
that yourself which is okay
for a founder to that.

242
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,060
Him or herself initially.

243
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,230
Over time you do not want to
be doing all of

244
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,920
the consistent voice editing
by yourself.

245
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,190
You are a trained people so

246
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,950
that they can recognize the
differences in voice.

247
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,430
So if you see this website
page it

248
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,190
looks very different than the
recruiting page.

249
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,410
You start by asking questions
why is that?

250
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,550
Is the reporting messed up?

251
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,910
Is the leaders over here not

252
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,960
really understanding the voice
of the company?

253
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,110
So, you've gotta, you have to
fix that over time.

254
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,920
But you want to start with the
objective of

255
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,280
everything should feel exactly
the same.

256
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,250
It's quite, quite difficult in
practice.

257
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,800
Almost every company has at
least one piece

258
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,470
of the organization that isn't
exactly on the same voice.

259
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,980
At Apple, which is notorious,
you know,

260
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,130
even under Steve's regime,
which was notorious for

261
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,610
getting this right.

262
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,710
If you asked someone who
worked at Apple, talk,

263
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,030
asked them about the internal
tools about recruiting.

264
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,580
Do they really feel like Apple
products?
