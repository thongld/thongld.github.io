793
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs
If you had more endorsements,

794
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,750
did you look at yourself in
the mirror more often?

795
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,650
Turns out you did.

796
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,900
So, we actually figured out
like

797
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,150
what was actually underneath
utilitarian product that

798
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,130
the product team thought they
were

799
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,210
building was actually a lot of
emotional vanity.

800
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,260
They didn't exactly translate
it to the best possible

801
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,590
feature, like the PayPal
example,

802
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,100
which you couldn't easily put
a button that,

803
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,333
said be more vain today, you
know, on the homepage.

804
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,077
>> That would probably not
work perfectly, so it

805
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,570
never really like took off the
way the PayPal example did.

806
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,370
But it clarified what the user
what users of

807
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,060
the product really wanted and

808
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,710
we wouldn't have found that
without looking for

809
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,370
anomalous data.

810
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,882
The final topic I want to talk
about is details.

811
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:36,800
And there's, in my assigned
reading,

812
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,490
there's a great book I really
like by BIll Walsh called,

813
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,850
The Score Takes Care of
Itself.

814
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,890
And the basic point of the
book is that if

815
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,260
you get all the details right,
you don't worry about how to

816
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,620
build a billion dollar
business,

817
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,250
how to have $100 million of
revenue,

818
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,620
how to have a billion users.

819
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,030
That's a byproduct of getting
all the details of what you

820
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,760
do everyday to be excellent.

821
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,960
So the example he talks about
in the book that really

822
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,600
resonated with me was he took
over the 49ers in 1979.

823
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,080
They were the worst team in
football.

824
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,960
I believe they were 2 and 14
the year before,

825
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,240
which is really bad for this,
if you don't know football.

826
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,140
In the next ten years, he
managed to transform the team

827
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,100
into the NFL's best, won three
Super Bowls.

828
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,650
And what's the first thing he
did to start going from

829
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,750
a terrible team to the best
team ever in many ways?

830
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,140
He actually taught the
receptionists how to

831
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,560
answer the phone properly.

832
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,270
He wrote a three-page memo
about how to

833
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,370
actually answer the phone.

834
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,940
Now, that may sound absurd.

835
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,670
But his point was, if the
organization as a whole

836
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,900
does everything exactly the
right way, then receivers, for

837
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,754
example, will start running
their routes at

838
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:41,940
seven-and-a-half yards, not
seven yards, not eight yards.

839
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,290
And that actually will matter.

840
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,530
And then everybody on the team
executes exactly up to

841
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,270
the same standard of
performance.

842
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,840
You will have an organization
that is performing at

843
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,260
the highest possible level,
and

844
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,060
then with enough random
variation, the highest

845
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,750
possible performance team will
do the best.

846
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,480
So the way you translate this
to a company are to

847
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,160
a lotta details that may not
matter.

848
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,110
They may not seem that they
matter superficially.

849
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,390
Most people would agree about
the details matter when it

850
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,740
faces the user.

851
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,930
But where the real debate is
on

852
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,220
things that don't face the
user.

853
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,200
So Steve Jobs famously in the
Mac,

854
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,390
insisted on an immaculate
circuit design board.

855
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,360
You can read about this in
various books.

856
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,130
The Mac, for those of you who
don't remember the Mac,

857
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,050
probably everybody here but

858
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,800
some of you may have seen it,
actually couldn't be opened.

859
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,190
So the circuit board design
couldn't be

860
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,280
seen by any single person in
the world.

861
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,350
There was no way to open the
Mac except the people who

862
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,420
worked at Apple, and Steve
insisted that it be

863
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,400
absolutely perfect and
beautiful.

864
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,850
That's the kind of detail
obsession that this sort of

865
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,250
philosophy of building a
company requires.

866
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,900
Examples that maybe more
practical for you instead of

867
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,950
circuit boards are things like
what food do you serve people.

868
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,190
This actually matters more
than you might guess.

869
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,260
When people don't like the
food you serve them,

870
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
what do they do.

871
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,180
They go gossip.

872
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,260
They go complain to their
friends.

873
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,930
They go walk over to someone's
desk.

874
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,950
And all the sudden at lunch,

875
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,770
what they're complaining about
is, it,

876
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,450
their mostly spending time
gossiping and

877
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,410
complaining instead of
brainstorming.

878
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,030
So you don't have this
serendipitous idea.

879
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,760
Not saying other serendipitous
idea that creates a spark,

880
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,950
instead they're all wandering
and wallowing around.

881
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,460
So the best thing you could do
is actually give

882
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,450
people the food they want or
food that's good for them.

883
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,782
That makes them more
productive.

884
00:31:09,782 --> 00:31:11,811
So it may seem a lot like this
glorious job

885
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:14,080
that you thought you had is
actually more like

886
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,485
running around being a task
rabbit for people.

887
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:17,149
But it's to

888
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:20,147
take the things off the plate
that are a distraction.

889
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:22,554
So that they can be
high-performance machines.

890
00:31:22,554 --> 00:31:25,092
And if you take enough things
away from people that distract

891
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,323
them and give them the tools
to be successful, all of

892
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:29,910
a sudden your organization
produces a lot more.

893
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,240
Similarly, another example
that's often got wrong is

894
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:32,930
office space.

895
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,970
So, one natural instinct is
when you need an office is to

896
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,880
have an office manager or

897
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,750
someone on your team go out
and find offices.

898
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,424
And they'll go on tours with
agents and

899
00:31:41,424 --> 00:31:43,580
they'll come back with photos
and ideas.

900
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,040
You need to do that yourself.

901
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,850
The office environment that
people live in and

902
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,750
work in everyday dictates your
culture and

903
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,520
how people make decisions, it
dictates how hard people work.

904
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,700
There's almost no important
more decision other than

905
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,050
what company you're going to
be, than what's the office

906
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,610
environment you're actually
in,

907
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,940
and most people don't do that.

908
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,000
And then the final thing and

909
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,520
then I'll take some questions
is around effort.

910
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,820
Ultimately, I don't believe
that you

911
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,800
can build a company without a
lot of effort and

912
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,590
that you'd need to lead by
example.

913
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,290
So Bill Wallace,

914
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,780
the first chapter of his books
is, get's asked this question

915
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,860
of how did you know whether
you're doing your job?

916
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,256
And this is the answer he
gives coaches that used to ask

917
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:25,960
him that question So if this
is what you

918
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,015
feel like every day, you're
probably on the right track.

919
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,221
And if that doesn't sound
appetizing,

920
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:30,930
you probably shouldn't start a
company, truthfully.

921
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,010
All right, with that I'm doing
with the prepared part.

922
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,480
Let me see if anybody has
questions I

923
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,360
can try to be helpful with.

924
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,910
Any questions?

925
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,010
Yes?

926
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,274
>> So you talked about making
compensation transparent.

927
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:47,168
How would you do this,
especially when people equate

928
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:51,480
themselves to value, you know,
of how much their salary is?

929
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,030
>> I would, I would do it in,
probably, bands.

930
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,840
because you could do it,

931
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,850
either just everybody in the
company gets paid the same, or

932
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,120
you could have, like, all
discipline, all engineers, or

933
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,190
you could do it by experience
like extreme exp.

934
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,802
The way Steve did it actually
at Next was,

935
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:04,195
there was a high band and a
low band.

936
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:05,926
And you either had a lot of
experience or

937
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:08,602
low experience, and that was
it, so low band back then, you

938
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,703
know, now it would probably be
like $85,000 kind of everybody

939
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:14,804
just flatly gets paid $85,000,
and if your super experienced

940
00:33:14,804 --> 00:33:17,694
everybody gets paid like
$130,000, and that's just it

941
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:20,095
like this sort of the Next
translated for inflation.

942
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:26,331
>> Instead of what's the how
many details

943
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:28,987
>> You'd be amazed.

944
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,126
>> Well, yeah, so the question
was besides food what

945
00:33:31,126 --> 00:33:33,860
other kind of details do
people care about?

946
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,770
The laptops they use.

947
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,730
I mean, this is now the
default that everybody has.

948
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,470
But five years ago,

949
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,890
it was a benefit to give
people high-quality machines

950
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,620
as opposed to optimizing our
costs and

951
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,580
having Dell machines and ugly
monitors, just as an example.

952
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,200
So if you think about all
these people that

953
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,490
are relentlessly resourceful,
incredibly talented in

954
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,150
a massively competitive
ecosystem competing for

955
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,900
talent, you want to give the
people the best

956
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,230
possible tools to do the best
possible job.

957
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,950
And so, right rigorously
thinking through how do I

958
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,510
make people more successful?

959
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,970
What things do they not need
to be

960
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,010
working on that are
distracting?

961
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,910
And what things can I

962
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,760
actually given them that make
them more valuable per day?

963
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,200
And then just break that down
every day and

964
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,230
solve that stuff yourself.

965
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,640
>> So, when you're in a
start-up environment,

966
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,010
how you you optimize for those
things?

967
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,640
because, you know, resources
are scarce and.

968
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,380
>> It's a good, it's a good
question.

969
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,770
I actually think that you
should start,

970
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,840
first of all, you must have
your own office.

971
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,990
I don't believe ever in shared
office spaces.

972
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,420
Peter talks a little bit about
this,

973
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,200
that every start-up, every
good start-up is a cult.

974
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,140
It's really hard to

975
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,350
create a cult if you're
sharing space with people.

976
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,290
Because a cult means that you

977
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,860
think that you're better than
everybody else in the world,

978
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,770
that you have a special way of
doing

979
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,680
things that's different than
everybody else in the world.

980
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,380
And if you're sharing physical
space with people,

981
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,930
it's very hard to inculcate
that.

982
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,050
So, I would start there, but

983
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,420
it is a prioritization
question.

984
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,370
When you have, everybody is

985
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,240
going to have scarce
resources, just a question of

986
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,490
magnitude like how many zeros
are you paying attention to?

987
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,873
You know, probably not $10.

988
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,628
Expenditures, put $100, then
$1,000,

989
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:55,980
then 10,000, then a million,
and then 10 million.

990
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,850
Starts being a rounding error.

991
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,980
So, what I would do is figure
out like,

992
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,870
what's most important?

993
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,920
And in a high quality office,
that creates a good vibe.

994
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,500
That allows you to recruit
people,

995
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
because recruits are very
savvy about this.

996
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,420
They walk into your office,
and

997
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,624
they can tell a lot about the
culture instantly.

998
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:12,510
I sometimes, I walk into a
company office and I can tell,

999
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,360
often, whether I'm going to
invest, as soon as I walk in.

1000
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,270
Like, I can absolutely rule
things out that I

1001
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,170
just don't want to invest in
as soon as I walk in.

1002
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,070
And there's times walking into
the office is like,

1003
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,650
wow, this is very impressive.

1004
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,230
You can tell how people worked
together,

1005
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,720
how hard they're working, how
distracted they are.

1006
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,900
Roelof Botha at Sequoia made a
point to me about YouTube.

1007
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,470
So, when I invested in
YouTube,

1008
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,410
in the very, very beginning,

1009
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,490
it wasn't obviously going to
be successful.

1010
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,310
And then, Roelof led this
series A investment for

1011
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,540
Sequoia in YouTube.

1012
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,750
And we were at a board meeting
together and he said,

1013
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,090
you know, I think YouTube's
really going to work.

1014
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,150
And I said, why?

1015
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,770
And he said well,

1016
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,770
every time I go to one of my
portfolio companies,

1017
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,740
half the office is watching
YouTube at lunch.

1018
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,930
>> And I was like, pretty good
sign.

1019
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,710
So like, if you pick up on
these little things you

1020
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,340
can predict a lot.

1021
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,570
Yeah?

1022
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,580
>> What do you think is the
best way to gain street cred

1023
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,640
for a new manager?

1024
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,740
>> Oh boy yeah so the question
is how's the best way to

1025
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,050
grain, gain street cred for a
new manager?

1026
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,760
Almost all good managers in
Silicon Valley are promoted

1027
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,000
because of their individual
performance in cultures that

1028
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,780
are meritocratic, you know,
the percentage is even higher.

1029
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,730
So we tried at PayPal to only
promote people that

1030
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,660
were basically kicking **** at
their discipline.

1031
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,650
So Peter didn't believe in
general managers.

1032
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,760
In fact, I remember going for

1033
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,070
a jog around campus within my
first week at PayPal and

1034
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,840
he's asking me, you know,

1035
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,680
how are things going, the
usual kind of CEO questions.

1036
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,390
And then we got into this

1037
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,490
debate about whether the
company needed any managers.

1038
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,450
And he's like, nope.

1039
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,430
No managers.

1040
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,440
We're only going to promote
people.

1041
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,010
So the VP of Engineering is

1042
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,150
going to be the single best
engineer.

1043
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,180
The VP of Design's going to be
the single best designer.

1044
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,840
The VP of Product's going to
be the single best product

1045
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,970
person and they're going to
learn to manage later.

1046
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,923
And the advantage of that is
you don't demoralize people,

1047
00:36:51,923 --> 00:36:54,120
because everybody knows that
their boss actually is

1048
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,190
better at their job than they
are, and they can learn stuff.

1049
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,400
And you can learn a little bit
of the management techniques

1050
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,530
later as opposed to promoting
people who

1051
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,560
are just good people managers
that don't actually have

1052
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,350
the discipline and skill, and
that does demoralize people.

1053
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,900
So I think, just being
excellent at something, and

1054
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,690
then getting excellent at
getting a bunch of people to

1055
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,014
do something is the next task.

1056
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,870
But people, you just have to
learn,
