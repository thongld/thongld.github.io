856
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:35,250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo
need to always think through
and try to overcome.

857
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,653
And there is always this
question about

858
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:42,280
competition as a form of
validation.

859
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,580
Where we go for

860
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,220
things that lots of other
people are going for,

861
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,980
and it's not that there is
wisdom in crowds, it's

862
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,220
not when lots of people are
trying to do something that,

863
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,180
that's proof of it being
valuable.

864
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,782
I think it's when lots of
people are trying to do

865
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:58,200
something that is often
proof of insanity.

866
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,460
There are twenty thousand
people a year who move to

867
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,570
Los Angeles to become movie
stars,

868
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,700
about 20 of them make it.

869
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,086
I think the Olympics are a
little bit better,

870
00:39:07,086 --> 00:39:10,829
because you can figure out
pretty quickly whether

871
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:14,748
you're good or not, so
there's a little bit less of

872
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:17,083
a dead weight loss to
society.

873
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,265
You know?

874
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:20,034
>> You the sort of
educational experience at

875
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:22,317
a place, the pre Stanford
educational experience.

876
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:23,332
There's always sort of

877
00:39:23,332 --> 00:39:25,413
a non-competitive
characterization, where I

878
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,746
think most of the people in
this room had machine guns,

879
00:39:27,746 --> 00:39:30,097
that were competing with
people with bows and arrows.

880
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:32,266
So it wasn't exactly a
parallel competition when

881
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:35,310
you were in junior high
school and high school.

882
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,530
There's always a question,

883
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,725
does the tournament make
sense as you keep going?

884
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:42,670
And there is always this
question if people go on to

885
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,930
grad school, or

886
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,270
post doctoral educations,
does the intensity of

887
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,780
the competition really make
sense?

888
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,360
There's the classic Henry
Kissinger line

889
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
describing his fellow
faculty at Harvard.

890
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,620
That the battles were so

891
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,990
ferocious, because the
stakes were so small.

892
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,570
Describing sort of academia.

893
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,984
And you start to think on
one level this is

894
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:06,690
a description of insanity.

895
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,620
Why would people fight like
crazy when the stakes are so

896
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,500
small?

897
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,210
But it's also,

898
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,390
I think simply a function of
the logic of the situation.

899
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,140
When it's really hard to
differentiate yourself from

900
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,970
other people.

901
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,170
When the differences are,
when

902
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,690
the objective differences
really are small.

903
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,948
Then you have to compete
ferociously to maintain

904
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:26,696
a difference of one sort or

905
00:40:26,696 --> 00:40:30,580
another, that's often more
imaginary than real.

906
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,550
There's always a sort of a
personal version of

907
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,830
this that I tell where I was
sort of hyper tracked.

908
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,580
My 8th grade junior high
school yearbook,

909
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,540
one of my friends wrote in,

910
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,390
I know you'll get into
Stanford in four years

911
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,150
as a Sophomore, sort of when
it is going to Stanford four

912
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,530
years later, the end of high
school.

913
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,780
Went to Stanford Law School.

914
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,805
You know, ended up at a big
law firm in New York,

915
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:57,070
where from the outside
everybody wanted to get in.

916
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,380
On the inside everybody
wanted to leave.

917
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,910
>> And it was this very
strange dynamic, where after

918
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,765
I sort of realized that this
was not the best idea,

919
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,830
and left after seven months
and three days.

920
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,700
You know, one of the people
down the hall from me told

921
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,860
me, it's really reassuring
to see you leave, Peter.

922
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,390
I had no idea that it was
possible to

923
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,607
escape from Alcatraz.

924
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,430
Which of course, all you had
to do was go out the front

925
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,900
door and not come back.

926
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,170
But so much of people
identities got

927
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,960
wrapped in winning these
competitions,

928
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,530
that they somehow lost site
of what was important.

929
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,180
What was valuable.

930
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,290
And you know, competition
does make you better

931
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,340
at whatever it is you're
competing on.

932
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,405
Because when you're
competing,

933
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:42,240
you're comparing yourself
with the people around you.

934
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,060
You're figuring out,

935
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,620
how do I beat the people
next to me?

936
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,560
How do I do somewhat better
at whatever it

937
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,880
is they're doing.

938
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,470
And you will get better at
that thing.

939
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,187
I'm not questioning that,
I'm not denying that.

940
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:56,120
But, it often comes at this
tremendous price that you

941
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,660
stop asking some bigger
questions,

942
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,008
about what's truly important
and truly valuable.

943
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:04,560
And so I would say, don't
always go through the tiny

944
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,860
little door that everyone's
trying to rush through.

945
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,020
Maybe go around the corner,
and

946
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,420
go through the vast gate
that no one's taking.

947
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,926
Thank you very much.

948
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:13,908
I guess there's time for,

949
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:16,499
do you want to take a few
questions?

950
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,463
>> Sorry?

951
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:25,211
>> Oh yes, people want to
take,

952
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,835
I'll take a few questions
with few minutes time.

953
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:28,792
Yeah, go ahead.

954
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,685
>> Since, yeah, as you
mentioned,

955
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,433
you already mentioned
further competition often

956
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:35,525
look similar because the
narrative of

957
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:36,913
people tell our selves.

958
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,300
Do you have any ways to

959
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,960
easily determine the
difference when your

960
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,690
looking at an idea that is
better than your own idea?

961
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,680
>> Well I'd say the question
I always try to focus on is

962
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,960
what is the actual market?

963
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,650
So not what's the narrative
of the market,

964
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,660
because you can always tell
a fictional story about

965
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,810
a market that's much bigger
or much smaller.

966
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,690
But what is the real
objective market?

967
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,020
So, it's always, yeah, you
always try to figure it out.

968
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,980
And you realize people have

969
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,820
incentives to powerfully
distort these things.

970
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,820
Yeah?

971
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,770
>> Which of the aspects of
monopolies that you

972
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,898
mentioned would you say
>> Well

973
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:15,720
they have network effects
with the ad network.

974
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,620
They had proprietary
technology that gave them

975
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,380
the initial lead, because
they had the page

976
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,760
rank algorithm which was
sort of, an order of

977
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,590
magnitude better than any
other search engine.

978
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,200
You have economies of scale,

979
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,350
because of the need to store
all these different sites.

980
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,320
And at this point, you have
brand, so

981
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,980
Google has all four.

982
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,770
Maybe the proprietary
technology's somewhat

983
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,710
weaker at this point.

984
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,790
But, definitely, it had all
four, and

985
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,960
maybe three out of four now.

986
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,760
Yeah.

987
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,980
>> How does this apply to
and, second, what's it like.

988
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,445
The seconds what?

989
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:46,240
>> What's with the i-Phone?
>> That's

990
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,610
sort of a set of companies
that are doing

991
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,560
different copycat payment
systems on mobile phones.

992
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,270
There's Square, there's
PayPal.

993
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,200
They just have sort of
different shapes.

994
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,700
That's how they
differentiate themselves.

995
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,400
One is a triangle, one is a
square.

996
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,770
And so you know...

997
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,250
>> Maybe at some point the
apes weren't out of shape or

998
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:05,960
something like that.

999
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,249
But I think, pounds here we
started with focus on

1000
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:13,182
the intelligence community
which is small sub-market,

1001
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:16,072
you had a proprietary
technology that used

1002
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:18,710
a very different approach.

1003
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,670
Were it was focused on the
human

1004
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,340
computer synthesis rather
than the substitution,

1005
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,620
which I think is the
dominant paradigm.

1006
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,180
So there's a whole set of
things I would say on

1007
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,120
the market approach, and on
the proprietary technology.

1008
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,480
Yes?

1009
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,712
>> When you have design
thinking methodology in

1010
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:44,710
a start-up thinking, which
is used to mitigate risk by

1011
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,220
not creating things that
people don't want.

1012
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,436
But I think young innovators
have inspiration create

1013
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:54,170
complex systems that last's
through time.

1014
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,430
>> Could you repeat the
question?

1015
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,926
>> Yeah.
So the quest is what do I

1016
00:44:56,926 --> 00:45:00,332
think about lean start-up's,
iterative thinking,

1017
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:02,578
where you get feedback from
people,

1018
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,908
versus complexity that may
not work.

1019
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:07,961
So, I am personally quite
skeptical of all the lean

1020
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:09,529
start-up methodology.

1021
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:13,382
I think the really great
companies did something that

1022
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:14,501
was, sort of.

1023
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:16,759
Somewhat more of a quantum
improvement that

1024
00:45:16,759 --> 00:45:19,390
really differentiated them
from everybody else.

1025
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,790
They typically did not do
massive, you know,

1026
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,230
customer surveys.

1027
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,600
The people who ran these
companies sometimes,

1028
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,950
not always, suffer from mild
forms of Aspberger's, so

1029
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,410
they were not actually that
influenced,

1030
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,800
not that easily deterred by
what other people thought or

1031
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,570
told them to do.

1032
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:39,840
So I do think we're way too
focused on iteration as

1033
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,720
a modality, and not enough
on trying to have a virtual

1034
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,199
esp link with the public and
figuring it out ourselves.

1035
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:56,890
I would say that, the risk
question

1036
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,160
is always a very tricky one
because there are, you know?

1037
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,740
They're, they're, it's not,
it's often.

1038
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,010
I think it's often the case
that you

1039
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,950
don't have enough time to
really mitigate risk.

1040
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,460
If, if you're gonna take
enough time to

1041
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,370
figure out what people want.

1042
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,480
You often will have missed
the boat by then.

1043
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,590
and, and then, of course,
there's always the risk of,

1044
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,050
of doing something that's,
that's not that,

1045
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,120
significant or meaningful.

1046
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,600
So, you know?
You could say a track in

1047
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,740
law school is a low risk
track from one

1048
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,430
perspective, it may still be
a very high risk track in

1049
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,040
the sense that maybe your
not, have a high risk of

1050
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,950
not doing something
meaningful with your life.

1051
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,800
So, we have to think about
risk in these,

1052
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,980
very complicated way.

1053
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,472
I think risk is for a very
complicated concept.

1054
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:44,320
Yes.
I was just checking for

1055
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,690
the last advantage, but then
doesn't that

1056
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,920
imply that there's already
competition to begin with

1057
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,040
between the chess pieces on
the chess board?

1058
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,900
>> Yeah, so, there's always
this terminology thing,

1059
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,190
so I would say that there
are categories in

1060
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,840
which people sort of are
bundled together.

1061
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,320
I would say the monopoly
businesses were in effect

1062
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,580
they really were a big first
mover in some sense.

1063
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,910
You could say Google was not
the first search engine.

1064
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,062
There were other search
engines before, but

1065
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:12,968
on one dimension,

1066
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:15,515
they were dramatically
better than everybody else,

1067
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,381
they were the first one with
page rank,

1068
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,650
with sort of an automated
approach.

1069
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,890
Facebook was not the first
social networking site.

1070
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,550
My friend, Reed Hoffman,
started one in 1997,

1071
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,900
and they called it Social
Net.

1072
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,170
So they already had the
name,

1073
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,070
Social networking, in the
name of their company,

1074
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,180
seven years before Facebook.

1075
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,990
Their idea was that it was
gonna be this virtual

1076
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,440
cyberspace, where I'd be a
dog and you'd be a cat.

1077
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,270
And we'd have all these
different rules about how

1078
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,735
we'd interact with each
other.

1079
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:42,310
>> In this virtual alternate
reality.

1080
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,770
Facebook was the first one
to get real identity.

1081
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,910
So, it was, so I would say,

1082
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,440
I hope Facebook will be the
last social networking site,

1083
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,780
it was the first one in a
very important dimension.

1084
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,760
People often would not think
of it as the first because

1085
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,680
they, sort of, lump all
these things together.

1086
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,715
>> I have one more question.

1087
00:47:57,715 --> 00:47:59,650
>> Okay, one question, let's
take one here.

1088
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,390
>> If you're theoretically
someone who,

1089
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,050
worked at Golden College and
left there after six months,

1090
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:11,180
and is now going to do
science at Standford.

1091
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,770
How would you recommend
rethinking

1092
00:48:16,408 --> 00:48:20,140
>> I don't have a great,

1093
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,650
I'm not great at the
psychotherapy stuff so

1094
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,020
I don't quite know how to
>> solve this.

1095
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,300
There are these very odd
studies they've

1096
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,530
done on people who go to
business school.

1097
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,680
There's one they've done at
Harvard Business school

1098
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,860
where it's sort of the
anti-Asperger, personality.

1099
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,910
We have people who are super
extroverted,

1100
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,290
generally have low
convictions, few ideas.

1101
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,970
And you have sort of a
hothouse environment.

1102
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:48,200
You put all these people in
for two years.

1103
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,110
And at the end of it, they
systematically end up,

1104
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,040
the largest cohort
systematically ends up

1105
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,770
doing the wrong thing.

1106
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,700
They tried to catch the last
wave.

1107
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,120
You know in 1989 everyone in
Harvard tried to work for

1108
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,150
Mike Milken, it was one or

1109
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,880
two years before he went to
jail for

1110
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,150
all the junk bond stuff.

1111
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,040
They were never interested
in Silicon Valley or

1112
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,810
tech, except for '99 and
2000 when they timed the dot

1113
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,660
com bubble peaking
perfectly.

1114
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,890
They did, and then '05 to
'07 was housing.

1115
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,770
Private equity, stuff like
this.

1116
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,640
I do think this tendency for

1117
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,190
us to see competition as
validation is very deep.

1118
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,170
I don't think there's any
sort of

1119
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,800
easy psychological formula
to avoid it.

1120
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,210
I don't know what sort of
therapy to recommend.

1121
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,260
>> But my first.

1122
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,609
My first starting point,

1123
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:40,061
which is only like maybe ten
percent of the way,

1124
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,740
is to never under estimate
how big a problem it is.

1125
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,480
We always think this is

1126
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,080
something that afflicts
other people.

1127
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,580
It's easy for

1128
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,490
me to point to people in
business schools or people

1129
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,500
at Harvard or people on Wall
Street, I think it actually

1130
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,900
does afflict all of us to a
very profound degree.

1131
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,150
We always think of
advertising as

1132
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,960
things that work on other
people.

1133
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,780
How, who are all these
stupid people who fall for

1134
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,710
all those ads on tv,

1135
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,370
they obviously work to some
extent and

1136
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,340
they work, to a disturbing
extant on all of us.

1137
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,210
And it's something we, we
all should work to overcome.

1138
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:12,460
Thank you very much.
