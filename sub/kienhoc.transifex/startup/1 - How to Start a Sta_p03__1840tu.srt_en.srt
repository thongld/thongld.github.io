511
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,100
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI
a small number of

512
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,710
people love to something
that a lot of people love.

513
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,660
Than from something that a
lot of

514
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,220
people like to a lot of
people love.

515
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,410
If you get this right,

516
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,920
you can get a lot of other
things wrong.

517
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,730
If you don't get this right,

518
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,700
you can get everything else
right,

519
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,910
and you'll probably still
fail.

520
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,500
So when you start on a
startup, this is the only

521
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,410
thing you need to care about
until it's working.

522
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,640
>> Excuse me, can you
explain that again?

523
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,190
>> Sure.
So you have

524
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,410
a choice in a startup.

525
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,080
The best thing of all worlds
would be to

526
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,650
build a product that a lot
of people will really love.

527
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,290
In practice you

528
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,240
can't usually do that
because of big company.

529
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,810
If there's an opportunity
like that, Google or

530
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,250
Facebook will do it.

531
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,070
So there's like a limit to
the area under the curve

532
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,860
of what you can build and
you can either build

533
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,160
something that lot of users
like a little bit or you can

534
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,980
build something that a small
number of users love a lot.

535
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,280
And, like, the total amount
of love is the same,

536
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,800
it's just a question of how
it's distributed.

537
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,610
And there's like this law of
conversation of

538
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,140
how much happiness you can
put into the world

539
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,160
with the first product of a
startup.

540
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,356
And so startups always
struggle with which of

541
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:39,640
those two they should go.

542
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
And they seem equal,

543
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,260
right, cuz the area under
the curve is the same.

544
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,480
But we've seen this time and
again that they're not.

545
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,120
And that it's so much easier
to expand.

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,330
Once you've got something
that some people love,

547
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:49,970
you can expand that

548
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,910
something that a lot of
other people love.

549
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,000
But if you only get
ambivalence or

550
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,860
sort of like weak
enthusiasm.

551
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,200
And then try to expand that,

552
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,820
you'll never get up to a lot
of people loving it.

553
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,340
So the advice is, uh, find a
small group of users and

554
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,660
make them really love what
you're doing.

555
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,230
Does that make sense?

556
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,800
All right.

557
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm, I'm, one way that you
know when this is

558
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,610
working is that you'll get
growth by word of mouth.

559
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,850
If you make something people
love

560
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,170
people will tell their
friends about it.

561
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,490
This works for consumer
products and

562
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,470
enterprise products, as
well.

563
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,780
When people really love
something,

564
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,000
they tell their friends
about it and

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,870
you'll see organic growth.

566
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,110
If you find yourself talking
about how it's okay that

567
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,400
you're not growing because
there's a big partnership

568
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
that's gonna come save you
or something like that,

569
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,820
it's almost always a sign of
real trouble.

570
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,230
Sales and marketing are
really important, and

571
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,260
we're gonna have two classes
on them later.

572
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,580
But if you don't have some
early organic growth,

573
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,170
then your product probably
isn't good enough yet.

574
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,616
A great product is the
secret to

575
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:48,786
long term growth hacking.

576
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:49,454
You should get

577
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,681
that right before you worry
about anything else.

578
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,259
It doesn't get easier to put
off making a great product.

579
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,040
If you try to build a growth
machine before you

580
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,910
have a product that some
people really love,

581
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,660
you're almost certainly
gonna waste your time.

582
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,670
Breakout companies almost
always have a product

583
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,190
that's so good that it grows
by word of mouth.

584
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,900
Over the long run great
products win.

585
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,110
Don't worry about your
competitors raising a lot of

586
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,750
money and what they may do
in the future.

587
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,270
They probably aren't very
good anyway.

588
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,840
Very few startups die from
competition.

589
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,530
Most die because they
themselves fail to

590
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,770
make something users love.

591
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,930
They spend their time on
other things.

592
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,520
So worry about this above
all else.

593
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,160
Another piece of advice to
make something that

594
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,530
users love is to start with
something simple.

595
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,830
It's much, much easier to
make a great product if

596
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,260
you have something simple.

597
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,050
Even if your eventual plans
are super complex, and

598
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,560
hopefully they are,

599
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,280
you can almost always start
with a smaller subset of

600
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,580
the problem than whatever
you think is the smallest.

601
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,980
And it's hard to build a
great product.

602
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,750
So you wanna start with as

603
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,850
little surface area as
possible.

604
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,490
Think about the really
successful companies and

605
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,920
what they started with.

606
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
Think about products that
you really love.

607
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,480
They're generally incredibly
simple to use and

608
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,700
especially to get started
using.

609
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,710
The first version of

610
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,030
Facebook was almost
comically simple.

611
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,540
The first version of Google
was just an ugly

612
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,950
webpage with a textbox and
two buttons but it returned

613
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,270
the best results, and that's
why users loved it.

614
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,520
The iPhone is far simpler to

615
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,630
use than any smartphone that
ever came before it and

616
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,080
it was the first one that
people really loved.

617
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,630
Another reason that simple
is good,

618
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,540
is because it forces you to
do one thing extremely well.

619
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
And you have to do that to
make

620
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,603
something that people love.

621
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:21,567
The word fanatical comes up
again and

622
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:25,582
again when you listen to
successful founders talk

623
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:29,033
about how they think about
their product.

624
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,770
Founders talk about being
fanatical in the way

625
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,180
they care about the quality
of the small details.

626
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,900
Fanatical in getting the
copy that they use to

627
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,370
explain the product just
right and fanatical in

628
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,670
the way they think about
customer support.

629
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,290
In fact, one thing that
correlates into

630
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,920
success among the YC
companies is the founders

631
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,340
that hook up pager duty to
their ticketing system, so

632
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,610
that even if the user emails
in the middle of

633
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,160
the night when the founders
are asleep.

634
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,370
They still get a response
within an hour.

635
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,390
Companies actually do this
in the early days.

636
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,500
These founders feel physical
pain when the product sucks.

637
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,010
And they wanna wake up and
fix it.

638
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,030
They don't ship crap.

639
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,690
And if they do they fix it
very, very quickly.

640
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,350
And it definitely takes some
level of

641
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,210
fanaticism to build a great
product.

642
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,280
You need some users to help
with the feedback cycle.

643
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,990
But the way to get those
users is manually.

644
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,190
You should go recruit them
by hand.

645
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,860
Don't do things like buy
Google ads in

646
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,100
the early days to get
initial users.

647
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,420
You don't need very many.

648
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,090
You just needs ones that
will give you feedback every

649
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,390
day and eventually love your
product.

650
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,470
So instead of trying to get
them on Google AdWords,

651
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,510
just find a few people in
the world that will be

652
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,270
good users.

653
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,970
Recruit them by hand.

654
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,880
Ben Silverman when everyone
though Pinterest was a joke,

655
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,385
recruited the initial
Pinterest users by

656
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:36,550
tagging up strangers in
coffee shops.

657
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,590
He really did.
He just walked around

658
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,300
Palo Alto and said will you
please use my product.

659
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,820
He also used to run around
the Apple store in

660
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,730
Palo Alto.

661
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,941
And he would like set all
the browsers to

662
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,706
the Pinterest home page real
quick before they caught him

663
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:46,340
and kicked him out.

664
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,990
So then when people walked
in there, they were like oh,

665
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,900
what is this?

666
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,650
This is an important example
of doing things

667
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,170
that don't scale.

668
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,460
If you haven't read Paul
Graham's essay on

669
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,030
that topic you definitely
should.

670
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,490
So get users manually and
remember that the goal is to

671
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,610
get a small group of them to
love you.

672
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,630
Understand that group
extremely well,

673
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,060
get extremely close into
them, close to them,

674
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,160
listen to them and you'll
almost always find out

675
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,610
that they're very willing to
give you feedback.

676
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,660
Even if you're building the
product for

677
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,090
yourself, listen to outside
users and

678
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,560
they'll tell you how to make
a product they'll pay for.

679
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,955
Do whatever you need to make
them love you,

680
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,690
make you're doing, cuz
they're also gonna be

681
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,440
the advocates that help you
get your next users.

682
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,260
You wanna build an engine in
the company that transforms

683
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,810
feedback from users into
product decisions then get

684
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,460
it back in front of the
users and then repeat.

685
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,124
Ask them what they like and

686
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,200
what they don't like, and
watch them use it.

687
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,020
Ask them what they pay for.

688
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,490
Ask them if they'd be really
bummed if

689
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,190
your company went away.

690
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,160
Ask them what would make
them recommend the product

691
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,190
to their friends.

692
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,260
And ask them if they've
recommended it to any yet.

693
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,980
You should make this
feedback loop as

694
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,330
tight as possible.

695
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,480
If your product gets 10%
better every week,

696
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,700
that compounds really,
really quickly.

697
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,760
One of the great advantages
of start,

698
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,930
of software startups is just
how short you

699
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,330
can make the feedback loop.

700
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,888
It can go circle in hours,
and the best

701
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,930
companies usually have the
tightest feedback loops.

702
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,120
You should try to keep this
going for

703
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,650
all of your company's life.

704
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,190
But it's really important in
the early days.

705
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,630
The good news is that all of
this is doable.

706
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,070
It's hard, it takes a lot of
effort, but

707
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,220
there's no magic.

708
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,460
The plan is at least
straight forward and

709
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,960
you will eventually get to a
great product.

710
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,510
Great founders don't put

711
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,740
anyone between themselves
and their users.

712
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,330
The founders of

713
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,830
these companies do things
like sales and

714
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,020
customer support themselves
in the early days.

715
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,650
It's critical to

716
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,440
get this loop embedded in
the culture.

717
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,850
In fact, the specific
problem that we

718
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,110
always see with Stanford
startups for

719
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,890
some reason is that the
students try and

720
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,880
hire sales and customer
support people right away.

721
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,280
And you've gotta do this
yourself.

722
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,910
It's the only way.

723
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,200
You really need to use
metrics to

724
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,340
keep yourself honest on
this.

725
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,560
It really is true that the
company will

726
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,080
build whatever the CEO
decides to measure.

727
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,730
If you're building an
internet service,

728
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,370
ignore things like total
registrations.

729
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,990
Don't talk about them.

730
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,950
Don't let anyone in the
company talk about them.

731
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,740
And look at growth in active
users, activity levels,

732
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,930
cohort retention, revenue,
net promoter scores.

733
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,000
These things that matter.

734
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,420
And then be brutally honest
if they aren't going in

735
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,460
the right direction.

736
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,390
Startups live on growth.

737
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,740
It's the indicator of a
great product.

738
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,020
So this about wraps up

739
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,422
the overview on building a
great product.

740
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,130
I wanna emphasize again,

741
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,300
that if you don't get this
right,

742
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,980
nothing else we talk about
in the class will matter.

743
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,463
You can basically ignore
everything else that we

744
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,090
talked about until this is
working well.

745
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,390
On the positive side,

746
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,580
this is one of the most fun
parts of building a startup.

747
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,740
So I'm gonna pause here,

748
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,910
I'll pick back up with the
rest of this on Thursday and

749
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,860
now we're gonna have Dustin
talk about why you should

750
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,470
start a startup.

751
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,490
Thank you for coming Dustin.

752
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:31,990
>> Sure.

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,100
But yeah.
So Sam asked me

754
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,450
to talk about why you should
start a startup.

755
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,830
There's a bunch of reasons
you might have.

756
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,030
And there's a bunch of
common reasons that

757
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,065
people have that I hear all
the time for, for

758
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,499
why you might start a
startup.

759
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,790
It's important to know,
like, what reason is yours.

760
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,660
Because some of them only
make sense in,

761
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,180
in certain contexts.

762
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,970
Some of them will actually
like lead you astray.

763
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,180
You may have been misled by
the way that Hollywood or

764
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,880
the press likes to

765
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,418
romanticize
entrepreneurship.
