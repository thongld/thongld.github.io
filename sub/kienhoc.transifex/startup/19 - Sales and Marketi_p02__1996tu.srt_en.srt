265
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,380
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHAh6WKBgiE
And the maybes are what kill
you.

266
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,440
If you can get to a yes or

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,520
a no, in some ways a no is, is
even better than a maybe.

268
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,560
Because it allows you to move
on and

269
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,670
focus on somebody who might be
a yes.

270
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,030
So, have this super-human
level of,

271
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,150
of follow up and ambition.

272
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,820
But make sure you're focusing
it on the right pieces.

273
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,430
All right.

274
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,240
So you've talked to someone,

275
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
you've talked to a ton of
people.

276
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
You've had all these phone
calls.

277
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,243
You've followed up with them
ridiculously.

278
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:36,119
To the point where they,

279
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,622
they just know you're not
going away, and

280
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:38,890
they've gotta sign an
agreement.

281
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,020
This final step is something
that,

282
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,790
if you haven't done before, it
might seem opaque, but

283
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,650
it's actually really simple.

284
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,580
It's called redlining.

285
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,370
So you'll send over an
agreement.

286
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,020
Their lawyers will mark it up.

287
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,451
Your Lawyers will mark it up
and

288
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,078
you kind of go back and forth.

289
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,345
If you're part of YC, this is
really easy because YC

290
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:59,030
has standard template
agreements that they give you.

291
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,920
So you don't have to find
these and

292
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,130
you can just you know, use
those.

293
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,740
But they've never been
available, you know,

294
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,050
if you weren't part of YC you
kind of had to

295
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,050
figure this out on your own.

296
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,080
One of the things that I'm
really excited about is,

297
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,680
as part of this presentation,

298
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,170
YC has agreed to open source
their deal documents.

299
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,440
So these documents that YC
founders used to

300
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,360
get are now going to be
available to everybody.

301
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,790
So this should never,
hopefully,

302
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,470
never be a barrier to anyone
who wants to do sales for

303
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,030
their start up.

304
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,560
You've got some great
documents.

305
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,670
And then the other thing I'll
say about this,

306
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,870
a place I see so many smart,
smart people go wrong,

307
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,320
is you gotta remember what
your goal is.

308
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,670
Your goal is to sign some
deals, and

309
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,760
get some reference customers,
and

310
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,470
get some validation and get
some revenue.

311
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,540
That, if you don't do that,

312
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,780
your start up is, is, you
know, toast.

313
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,770
So in light of that, it's
really surprising how many

314
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,230
smart people will want to do
ten rounds of document review.

315
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,710
Quibbling over the most minor
points because of pride,

316
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,930
because of intelligence,
whatever.

317
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,860
You know, make sure the
agreement is the way

318
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,840
you want it, but then sign it
and move on.

319
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,880
I've seen founders spend
months quibbling over

320
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,480
some indemnification clauses.

321
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,210
And their business would have
been way better off if they'd

322
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,630
you know, just signed the deal
and moved onto the next one.

323
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,200
So, that's one closing trap
you can fall into.

324
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,770
I've two more.

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,050
One other closing trap that I
see founders struggle with

326
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,160
a lot, is they're talking to a
company who says,

327
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,790
I will use your product, but I
just need one more feature.

328
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,380
You know?
Or

329
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,850
they say you know, I'd love to
use your product but

330
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,823
it doesn't have this one
feature so

331
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,727
we're just not ready.

332
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:38,060
And to most people, especially
if you're ambitious,

333
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,680
when somebody says that to you
what you want to hear is, oh,

334
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,960
well I can build that feature.

335
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,740
Great.
You know,

336
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,420
I'll build that feature and

337
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,330
then they're going to use my
product.

338
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,420
But the problem is, it almost
never works that way.

339
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,470
In fact, somebody telling you
that they would use your,

340
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,530
they want to use your product
but

341
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,860
it's just missing this one
feature.

342
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,050
I would almost map that to a
pass in your mind.

343
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,850
Because nine times out of

344
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,080
ten if you actually build that
feature.

345
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,840
You go back to them and

346
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,110
then there'd be one more
feature, or there'd be

347
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,000
some other reason that they're
not using the product.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,910
So, if somebody says to you
hey, I want to, but, you know,

349
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,160
there's this one thing that's
preventing us

350
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,190
from using your product.

351
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,300
I would do one of two things.

352
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,040
One say, well that's great.

353
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,150
Let's sign an agreement.

354
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
And we'll put in

355
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,840
the agreement that we're
going to build this feature.

356
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,300
In which case, you know,

357
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,280
you know that if you build it
you're off to the races.

358
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,670
Or more commonly,

359
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,516
what we did at Clever was we
would say, that's great.

360
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:27,680
We're going to wait to see if

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,120
we hear that demand from more
customers.

362
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,090
And then once you have a lot
of customers requesting it,

363
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,602
then you should build it
regardless.

364
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,190
And then, and then you're not,

365
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,830
you don't have to worry about
doing something that's

366
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,610
customer one-off, which is
what you really want to avoid.

367
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,880
So, don't fall into this trap,
it happens all the time.

368
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,480
And the other trap I would
highly,

369
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,140
highly recommend you try to
avoid is the free trial trap.

370
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,420
Because this hap, happens all
the time.

371
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
People, you know, they go down
this path with a,

372
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,860
with a customer, it seems
really exciting.

373
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,880
And then the customer says,
oh,

374
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,010
well can I get a free trial?

375
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,120
And you can't blame them.

376
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,310
That's a totally reasonable
thing to ask for.

377
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,380
But the problem is,

378
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,490
when you're starting a start
up you need revenue,

379
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,040
you need validation, you need
users, you need commitment.

380
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,970
And free trials get you none
of those things.

381
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,430
So you go, you do all this
work, and

382
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,970
if you end up with a free
trial,

383
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,500
unfortunately, you haven't
made as much progress as you.

384
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,255
It's actually terrible.

385
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,490
You, you think you've made
progress.

386
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,900
But really, at the end of the
free trial,

387
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,880
you're going to have to sell
them all over again.

388
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,970
So the way I handle this that
has worked really well,

389
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,472
is when somebody says, can I
get a free trial?

390
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:33,270
You say, well we don't, we
don't do free trials.

391
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,670
But what we can do is we're
going to,

392
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,600
we do annual agreements here.

393
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,130
And what we'll do is for the
first 30 or 60 days, if for

394
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,740
any reason you're not happy,
you can opt out.

395
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,300
And that's a way to get you
the things that you need,

396
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,240
while giving them the comfort
that they might need to take

397
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
a chance on a start up.

398
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,570
So that minor change is
actually makes a night and

399
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,480
day difference when you're,

400
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,930
when you're thinking about
these things.

401
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,930
All right.
So, you've prospected.

402
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,650
You've had a lot of
conversations.

403
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,630
Now you've closed people.

404
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,890
You've gone through the
redline process.

405
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,330
You worked out the free
trials.

406
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,310
And you're on your way,

407
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,480
hopefully, to your first
sales.

408
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,310
Now early on, you could think
of

409
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,040
sales as just like any other
thing of a start up.

410
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,550
Your goal is to, you don't
have to do things that scale.

411
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,040
In fact you can purposely do
unscalable things to try and

412
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,590
get early customers.

413
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,540
That's, that's the fun of it.

414
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,250
But the other thing that I
think is really important to

415
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,820
keep in mind is, once you've
done this enough.

416
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,760
What you should start thinking
about is,

417
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,480
well what aspects of this are
repeatable?

418
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,710
And, and what aspects of this,
you know,

419
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,760
are we going to scale further?

420
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,540
And there's this,

421
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,000
Cristoph Janz has this really
great blog post online about

422
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,087
the five ways to build a $100
million company.

423
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,781
And he talks about, he can
have a thousand customers buy

424
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:45,798
a product that costs $100,000.

425
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,484
Or he can have 10,000
customers buy

426
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,080
a product that costs $10,000.

427
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,819
Or he can have 100,000
customers buy

428
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,278
a product that costs $1,000.

429
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,094
And even though you don't need
to know on day one,

430
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,330
which bucket you're going to
fall into.

431
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,010
Most companies do fall into
one of these buckets.

432
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,100
And so, you should start
thinking about that as

433
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,048
you're doing this.

434
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,876
If, if you want to be in the
elephant category of

435
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,650
$100,000 product, that's
great.

436
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,360
And you're going to have a
really high touch sale cycle,

437
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,230
and that's fine.

438
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,183
You know, that's sales force.

439
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,590
That's work day, that's great.

440
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,840
But if you think you're
going to be a rabbit, and

441
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,790
sell products for $1,000 a
year to businesses.

442
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,580
And your sales process
involves flying out

443
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,700
to see them three times and
eight demos and, and you know,

444
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,900
three months of redlining.

445
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,180
Then you probably have to
rethink something.

446
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,970
And so I see a lot of startups
most commonly in that,

447
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,330
who want to be the rabbits.

448
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,190
And sell for a low priced
product to businesses,

449
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,910
not thinking about how to do
it in a scalable way.

450
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,590
And that's one area where you
can get underwater.

451
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,290
Or it just forces you to
increase your prices.

452
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,230
So this is how I think about
different businesses.

453
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,390
And it'll be helpful for you
when,

454
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,670
once so you can get started,
and

455
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,240
once you've done enough of the
sales to say, okay.

456
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,620
You know, where am I?

457
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,540
And the corollary to that is,
is, how do

458
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,730
I have to price my product, to
be a viable business?

459
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,598
So that is, those are some of
the things that I figured out

460
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:09,212
along the way building,
building sales now at a few,

461
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,280
at a few different companies.

462
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,450
And specifically on this very
narrow stage of,

463
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,100
of zero to 1 million.

464
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,880
After you get to 1 million,

465
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,970
you'll find there's a million
blog posts, you know,

466
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,080
about how to get from 5
million to 50 million.

467
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,090
Or 10 million to 100 million.

468
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,270
But this zero to one step, I
wanted to ded,

469
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,560
focus the presentation on that
today.

470
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,270
Because there's not as much
written about it and it is

471
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,619
something that I think is very
opaque to a lot of founders.

472
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,440
I figured this out just by
doing it.

473
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,280
And I'm confident that if
you're starting a company,

474
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,550
you can too.

475
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,190
If for whatever reason you
would like to do what I

476
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,120
did and join a startup that's
figured it out and,

477
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,840
and hone your skills and hone
your craft.

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,730
We are hiring at Clever, so
that's an option.

479
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,120
>> But even if, and if that
doesn't,

480
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,850
if you do want to start your
own company, and

481
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,260
you have questions about
sales,

482
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,390
I put my e-mail address up
here.

483
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,361
And feel free to reach out at
any time, I'm happy to help.

484
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,537
So, thank you.

485
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,108
>> Thank you very much.

486
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,620
>> Yeah.
>> That was awesome.

487
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,940
All right.
So now, we're going to talk

488
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,360
about a little bit more detail
on how to raise money.

489
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,230
Michael Seibel is first going
to talk about how to

490
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,073
have a pitch.

491
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:17,730
And then Dalton and Qasar will
do investor role playing.

492
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,590
>> Yeah, sure.

493
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,357
My name is.

494
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,944
Mind blowingly you know, new.

495
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:28,045
It really is basic blocking
attack.

496
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,409
And the one point I wanted to
make before we get started is,

497
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:32,096
we actually don't spend a lot
of time at YC

498
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,474
focusing on this.

499
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,245
The main reason is, the best
way you can

500
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:38,040
make your pitch better is to
improve your company.

501
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,410
If you're, if you have
traction and

502
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,350
your product is doing well,
these conversations are like,

503
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,150
the investors want to see you
succeed.

504
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,200
And so, if you remember
anything,

505
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,080
it's make your company better
and the pitch will be easier.

506
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,780
We're going to spend the time
in the three kind of sections

507
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,330
before the meeting, which
Michael will kind of focus on.

508
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,970
We'll do a kind of,

509
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,070
a role play of what meeting's
actually look like.

510
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,300
And then we'll just wrap it
up.

511
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,620
We are going to do Q&A at the
end,

512
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,070
we'll kind of save five
minutes.

513
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,220
So if there's something we
don't cover,

514
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,880
please write down your
questions and

515
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,410
we'll go through them.

516
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,490
Now, without further ado.

517
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:08,990
>> Beautiful.

518
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,408
>> All right.

519
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,550
>> So, my name is Michael
Seibel.

520
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,470
I'm a current YC partner.

521
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,510
I've started two companies.

522
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,530
One was called Justin TV.

523
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,700
It ended up selling to Amazon.

524
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,370
The other was called
SocialCam,

525
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,412
which sold to Auto Desk.

526
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:29,380
And what I really wanted to do
was break down and

527
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,230
demystifying the process of
creating a pitch.

528
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,254
Because I think what happens
too often,
