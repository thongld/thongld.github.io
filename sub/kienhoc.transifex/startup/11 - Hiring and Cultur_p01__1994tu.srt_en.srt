Part two of Culture and
Team, and

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:05,708
we have Ben Silverman, the
founder of Pinterest, and

3
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:08,530
John and Patrick Collison,
the founders of Stripe.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,300
Founders that have obviously
sort of, some of the best in

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,190
the world at thinking about
culture and

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,940
how they build teams.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,400
So, there's three areas that
we're gonna cover today.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,690
One will just be sort of
general thoughts on

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,980
culture as a follow up to
the last lecture.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,580
And then we're really gonna
dig into what happens at

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,120
the founding of these
companies.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,790
And building out the early
team.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,530
And then how that changes
and evolves as these

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,940
guys have scaled their
companies up to 100 plus.

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,270
I don't even know how many
people you have now,

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,380
but quite a lot.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,520
Very large organizations and

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,240
how you adapt these
principles of culture.

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,205
But to start off I just
wanna ask a very

20
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,970
open-ended question which
is,

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,010
what are the core pieces of
culture that you found to

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,951
be most important in
building out your companies?

23
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,720
>> So what are the most
important parts?

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,829
>> It's on.
>> Oh, it's on.

25
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:02,769
Yeah I mean I think for

26
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,910
us, like we think about on a
few dimensions.

27
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,780
One is like who do we hire,

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,180
and what do those people
value?

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,950
Two is what do we do every
day, like why do we do it?

30
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,460
Three is what do we choose
to communicate?

31
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,480
And then I think the fourth
is what we

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,460
choose to celebrate.

33
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,220
I guess the converse of

34
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,590
that is like what you choose
to punish.

35
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,880
But in general I think
running a company based on

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,490
what you celebrate,

37
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,360
is more exciting than what
you punish.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,040
But I think those four
things kind of make up

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
the bulk of it for us.

40
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:38,666
>> We've placed a large
emphasis on, as Stripe has

41
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,536
grown and probably more than
other companies is,

42
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,560
transparency internally.

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,940
And I think it's been
something that's been

44
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,505
really valuable for

45
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,460
Stripe, and also a little
bit misunderstood.

46
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,740
All the things people talk
about like hiring really

47
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,070
great people, or giving them
a huge amount of leverage.

48
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,220
Transparency for us plays
into that.

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,335
We think that, if you are
aligned at a high

50
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:07,340
level about what Stripe is
doing, if everyone really

51
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,078
believes in the mission, and
then if everyone has

52
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:14,639
really good access to
information, and kind of

53
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,401
has a good picture of the
current state of Stripe.

54
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,175
Then that gets you a huge
amount of the way there in

55
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,230
terms of working
productively together.

56
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,760
And it kind of forgives a
lot of the other things that

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,790
tend to break as you, as you
grow a start-up.

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,090
As we've grown, we started
off two people.

59
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,980
We're now over 170 people.

60
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,160
We've put a lot of thought
into the tooling that

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,170
goes around transparency,
because at 170 people,

62
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,100
there is so much information
being produced,

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,420
that you can't just consume
it all as a fire hose.

64
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,300
And so

65
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,820
how we use slack, how we use
email, things like that.

66
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,030
We can go into it more
later.

67
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,420
But I think that's one of

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,060
the core things that's
helped us work well.

69
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,180
>> I think culture to some
degree is basically kind of

70
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,790
the resolution to a
bandwidth problem.

71
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,480
In the sense that, maybe
when you start out working

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,270
on something, you're sort of
coding all the time, but you

73
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,580
can't code all the things
that you think the product

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,440
might need, or the company
might need, or whatever, and

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,150
you so you decide to work
with more coders, right?

76
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,870
And so the organization gets
larger.

77
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,590
And maybe, in some idealized
world,

78
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,750
I don't think this actually
true, but kind of ideally

79
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,950
you could be involved in
every single decision, and

80
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,370
every single sort of moment
of the company, and

81
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,820
everything that happens, but
obviously you can't, or

82
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,260
maybe you can if two people.

83
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,440
But you certainly can't at
even like five or

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,530
ten kind of that point comes
very quickly,

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,710
then by the time you're 50
it's completely hopeless.

86
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,570
And so culture is kind of
how you kind of,

87
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,110
what the strands are that
you sort of want to have,

88
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,630
the invariance that you want
to kind of maintain,

89
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,840
as you can get specifically
involved in sort of

90
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,338
fewer and fewer decisions
over time.

91
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:56,192
And I think when you think
about it that way it,

92
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:59,680
maybe its kind of importance
becomes sort of

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,610
self evident, right?

94
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,030
Because again, like the
fraction of things you

95
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,240
can be involved in directly
is diminishing, I mean,

96
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,130
almost exponentially,

97
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,430
sort of assuming your head
count growth sort of is

98
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,290
on a curve that looks like
one of the great companies.

99
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,700
And yeah that's super
important.

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,648
And again, it manifests
itself in a bunch of

101
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:21,850
different ways.

102
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,680
Like for example, in hiring,
I think a large part of

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,810
the reason why maybe the
first ten people you hire,

104
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,920
what kind of goes to ship,

105
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,760
decisions are so important
is because you're not just

106
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
hiring those first ten
people.

107
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,330
You're actually kind of
hiring 100 people.

108
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,700
Because you should think of
kind of

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,790
each one of those people as
bringing along sort of

110
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,580
another ten people with
them, and

111
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,830
sort of figuring out exactly
what 90 people, you would

112
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,070
like those first ten people
to bring along is obviously

113
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,360
gonna be quite consequential
for your company.

114
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,940
But really briefly I think
it's largely about sort of

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,020
abstraction.

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,780
>> So one thing that a lot
of speakers in this

117
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,910
class have touched on is how
hiring those first ten

118
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,670
employees, if you don't get
that right,

119
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,978
the company basically will
never recover but

120
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:10,180
no one has talked about how
to do that so.

121
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,000
What have the three of you
looked for

122
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,190
when you've hired these
initial employees,

123
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,800
to get the culture of the
company right?

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,835
How, how have you found
them, and

125
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:21,630
what have you looked for?

126
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,610
>> Sure.
So,

127
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,542
I guess this answer is
different for every

128
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:32,640
company and I'll say for us
it was very inductive.

129
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,390
So I literally looked for
people that I wanted to work

130
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,960
with and that I thought were
talented.

131
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,960
I think, I've read all these
books about culture,

132
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,130
because when I don't know
how to do something,

133
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,730
I first go read things and

134
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,920
everyone has all these
frameworks.

135
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,090
And I think one bit, big
misconception that someone

136
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,270
said once is that people
think culture is like

137
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,480
architecture when it's a lot
more like gardening.

138
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,650
You know, you plant some
seeds and

139
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,050
then you pull out weeds that
aren't working,

140
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,570
and they sort of expand.

141
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,650
So, when we first hired
people we hired people that

142
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,520
were like ourselves.

143
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,030
I often looked at like three
or

144
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,460
four different things that I
really valued in people.

145
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,700
You know, I looked for
people that worked hard and

146
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,890
seemed high integrity and
low ego.

147
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,490
I looked for people that
were creative, and

148
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,170
I usually meant that they
were really curious.

149
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,430
They had all these different
interests.

150
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,120
Some of our first employees
are probably some of

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
the quirkiest people I've
ever met.

152
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,250
They were engineers but

153
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,540
they also have all these
crazy hobbies.

154
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,390
Like one guy made his own
board game

155
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,240
with this elaborate set of
rules.

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Another guy was really into
magic tricks.

157
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,210
And he had coded not only
like this magic trick on

158
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,000
the iPhone, but

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,290
he had shot the production
video with a preview.

160
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,400
And I think that, that
quirkiness has actually been

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,390
a little bit of a calling
card.

162
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,770
And we find that really
creative, quirky people that

163
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,710
are excited about many
disciplines, and are

164
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,720
extraordinary at one tend to
build really great products.

165
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,220
They tend to be great at
collaborating.

166
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,610
Then the last thing is, we
really look for

167
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,390
people that wanted to,

168
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,180
they just wanted to build
something great, and

169
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,720
they weren't arrogant about
it, but they just felt like,

170
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,190
it'd be really cool to take
a risk and

171
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,530
build something bigger than
themselves.

172
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,790
And that, in the beginning,
is very,

173
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,250
very easy to select for if
you're in our situation.

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,260
We had this horrible office,
like, nobody got paid.

175
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,530
So there was no external
reason, other than being

176
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,810
excited about building
something to join.

177
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,770
In fact, there was every
reason not to.

178
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,410
And that's something,
looking back,

179
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,170
I really, really value,

180
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,080
because we always knew
people were joining for

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,275
the purest reasons, and in
fact,

182
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,680
were willing to forgo other
great job opportunities,

183
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,190
market salary, a clean
office,

184
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,540
good equipment just for the
chance to work.

185
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,540
So, to this day I think a
lot of those traits have

186
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,230
been seeded and

187
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,050
are embedded in the folks
that we look at now.

188
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,400
>> Yeah the first ten hires
are really

189
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,950
hard because you're making
these first ten

190
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,500
hires at a point where no
one's heard of this company,

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,550
no one really wants to work
for it.

192
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,530
You're just these,

193
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,140
like two weird people
working on this weird idea.

194
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,070
>> And like their friends
are telling them not

195
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,190
to join.

196
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,320
For our second employee, I
think

197
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,800
he'd accepted the offer or
he was just about to, and

198
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,700
his best friends took him
out the night before, and it

199
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,596
was like a full on assault
for, why you should not join

200
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:09,250
this company, why this is
ruining your life basically.

201
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,720
And so anyway the guy
subsequently

202
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,750
continued to join.

203
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,598
And actually one of

204
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,771
those friends also now works
at Stripe.

205
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:20,067
But this is what you're up
against.

206
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:20,934
>> Yeah.

207
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,362
And I mean it's also hard
because no batch of

208
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:27,790
ten people will have as
great an influence on

209
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,630
the company as those first
ten people.

210
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,640
I think everyone's
impression of recruiting is,

211
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,430
you open LinkedIn.

212
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,050
It's sort of like ordering
off the dollar menu.

213
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,190
It's, I want that one, that
one, and that one.

214
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,543
And, and now you have some
hires.

215
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:46,606
Whereas at least for us, it
was very much over a very

216
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:50,103
long time period, talking
people we knew or

217
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:53,780
friends of friends into
joining.

218
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,880
We didn't have huge
networks, Pat and

219
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,100
I were both in college at
the time.

220
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,630
So there were no people that

221
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,750
we'd really worked with to
draw on, and so

222
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,280
a lot of those early Stripes
were people we had heard of,

223
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,990
friends of friends, and the
other interesting thing they

224
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,665
all had in common is that
they were all

225
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:16,400
early in their career, or
undervalued in some way.

226
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,290
Cuz when you think about it,

227
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,430
if someone is a known
spectacular quantity,

228
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,570
then they're probably
working in a job and

229
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,730
very happy with that.

230
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,720
And so we have to try and
find people who were,

231
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,860
in the case of our designer
that we hired, he was 18 and

232
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,970
in high school and in Sweden
at the time.

233
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,820
In the case of our,

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,040
our CTO, he was in college
at the time.

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,030
You know, a lot of these
people,

236
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,820
they were early on in their
careers and

237
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,920
the only way we could, you
can relax when constrained.

238
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,940
You can relax the fact that
they're talented or

239
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,212
relax that it's apparent
that they're talented,

240
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:56,240
and we, not consciously, but
we relaxed the latter.

241
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,320
>> Yeah, I think finding
kind of people who are, or

242
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,130
just think like a value
investor.

243
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,170
You're looking for the human
capital that's

244
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,900
significantly devalued by
the market, you know?

245
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,940
You probably shouldn't look
to

246
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,850
hire your brilliant friends
at Facebook and Google or

247
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,050
whatever, because they're
already discovered.

248
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,510
You know, if they're wanting
to join that's great,

249
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,919
but they're probably harder
to convince.

250
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,570
John and I spent a little a
while yesterday

251
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,790
afternoon sort of trying to
figure out in retrospect,

252
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,490
what kind of traits our
first ten or

253
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,320
so people had in common that
we thought were significant.

254
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,711
And you know, in general
sort of in speaking about

255
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:41,182
culture, I sort of want to
caveat everything we say

256
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,785
with, I that sort of advice
is very limited experience,

257
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,785
widely over extrapolated.
