529
00:20:34,254 --> 00:20:36,217
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHAh6WKBgiE
when I see companies come to
talk to me,

530
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:39,192
is that they don't know how to
simply explain what they do,

531
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,800
and then ask for money.

532
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,070
And that's basically what you
have to do as a founder.

533
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,830
So we're going to go over four
things.

534
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,760
The first is what your 30
second pitch is.

535
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,540
This you need to be armed with
constantly.

536
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,870
This is basically, how you
talk about your company.

537
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,700
This is magic.

538
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,690
Whether you're talking to
people who want to give you

539
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,050
money or don't want to give
you money.

540
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,540
You're talking to your
parents.

541
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,420
This is your go to.

542
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,400
The second is your two minute
pitch.

543
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,822
This is for people who are
more interested.

544
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:06,853
This is people who you might
want to raise money from.

545
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,947
Or people who you might want
to get to work for you, or

546
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:09,860
people you actually.

547
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,453
Kind need to get a little bit
deeper.

548
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:13,882
Notice that's where I stop.

549
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:16,706
A lot of people practice 10,
30 minute pitches,

550
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,170
hour pitches, I think that's
all garbage.

551
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,198
I think you can get everything
you need done in two minutes.

552
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,792
And one thing I like to tell
founders is the more you talk,

553
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,414
the more you have the
opportunity to

554
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:28,270
say something that people
don't like.

555
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,560
So just talk less and it'll
probably be better.

556
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,550
So, then I want to tell you
about when to fund raise,

557
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,260
because I think a lot of

558
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,870
companies get this a little
bit wrong.

559
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,630
And then, quickly, how to set
up investor meetings.

560
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,540
So, 30 second pitch, this is
so

561
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,970
simple, it's three sentences.

562
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,360
You can take your time, you
can breathe when you do this,

563
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,680
you don't have to get that
much information out.

564
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,490
The first is one sentence on
what does your company do.

565
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,980
Everyone I meet for the first
time screws this up.

566
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,410
You have to be able to do it
in a way that is simple and

567
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,370
straightforward, that requires
no pre-information on my part.

568
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,140
You have to assume I know
nothing, literally nothing,

569
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,050
about anything.

570
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,630
This is how you make it super
simple.

571
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,510
So you know, usually what we

572
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,740
tell people is apply the mom
test.

573
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,220
If in one sentence you cannot
tell your mom what you do,

574
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
then rework the sentence.

575
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,790
There is a one sentence
explanation that your mom, or

576
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,930
your dad is going to
understand.

577
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,150
So really, really start there,
and

578
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,050
it's okay if you use really
basic language.

579
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,230
It's okay if you're saying hey
we're Air B and B,

580
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,580
and we allow you to rent out
the extra room in your house.

581
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,530
That's simple, right?

582
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,870
You don't have to say we're
Air B and

583
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,410
B and we're a marketplace for
space.

584
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,740
I don't know what that is.

585
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,670
And it's going to require more
time.

586
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,640
So use simple language.

587
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,590
Very, very important.

588
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,250
The second is how big is your
market?

589
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,760
It makes sense to do a couple
hours of research.

590
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,700
Figure out what general
industry your product is in.

591
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,070
Figure out how big it is.

592
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,790
Investors like to

593
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,100
hear that you're in a
multibillion dollar market.

594
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,360
It's pretty simple to do this.

595
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,072
You know, Air B and

596
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:09,740
B might say, how big is the
hotel market?

597
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,560
How big is the vacation rental
market?

598
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
How big is the online hotel
booking market?

599
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,240
These are simple numbers to
look up on Google.

600
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,960
And it makes an investor
understand, oh wait,

601
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,330
if we're big, if we really
blow this company up,

602
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,860
it can be worth billions of
dollars.

603
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,940
Don't skip this step.

604
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,220
Second sentence, how big is
your market?

605
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,130
Third sentence, how much
traction do you have?

606
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,240
Ideally this sentence is
saying something on

607
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,380
the order of, we launched in
January and

608
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,570
we're growing 30% month over
month.

609
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,900
We have this number of sales,
this amount of revenue,

610
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,610
this number of users.

611
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,190
Very simple.

612
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,835
If you can't speak to traction
in terms of

613
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:48,680
pre-launch, you need to
convince the investor that

614
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,060
you're moving extremely
quickly.

615
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,530
So, the team started working
in January, by March,

616
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,360
we launched a beta, by April,
we launched our product.

617
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,890
Right?

618
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,850
Convince the investors that
you guys are moving fast.

619
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,730
That this isn't some long slog
that you guys aren't thinking

620
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,140
about this like a big
cooperation.

621
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,230
Your thinking about it

622
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,060
like a startup where you can
move fast and make mistakes.

623
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,890
That's all you have to do in
30 seconds.

624
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,188
Three sentences.

625
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:14,770
From that basis you should be
able to

626
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,940
start a conversation about
your company.

627
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,780
From that basis I understand
exactly what you do.

628
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,570
You have no unders, you have
no idea how valuable it is to

629
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,490
be able to explain to someone
what you do in 30 seconds,

630
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,890
so really internalize that.

631
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,610
Like if you take nothing else
away,

632
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,260
that's going to help you.

633
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,110
Okay.

634
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,780
Two minute pitch.

635
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,960
Now you've got someone you
actually have to

636
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,910
convince of something.

637
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,150
Maybe even someone you have to
ask for money.

638
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,250
So, I like to add four
additional components and

639
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,370
these also go by very quick.

640
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,340
The first is unique insight.

641
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,230
Now, if you talk to VCs
they'll say stuff like, what's

642
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,860
your secret sauce, what's your
competitive advantage,

643
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,300
what's your unique insight?

644
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,270
It's all the same thing.

645
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,640
When I think about unique
insight,

646
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,620
what I think about is here's
your opportunity to tell me

647
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,569
something that I don't know.

648
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,760
Here's your opportunity to
tell me

649
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,190
something that the biggest
players in the market you're

650
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,840
trying to enter don't
understand or don't do well.

651
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,510
This is the ah-ha moment.

652
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,160
And you'd better have it down
in two sentences.

653
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,940
The ah-ha moment.

654
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,680
So you've gotta crystallize
all of the reasons why you

655
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,320
guys are going to kill the
competitors, or the really

656
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,310
intelligent thought that got
this business started.

657
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,560
In two sentences, and I need
to ah-ha.

658
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,590
You can see whether it's

659
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,090
happening when you're saying
it.

660
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,360
That's why I like two
sentences, so

661
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,070
you get in and out fast.

662
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,070
So if I look at you and I'm
like huh.

663
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,800
Then it's okay, you've nailed
it.

664
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,360
If I look at you and

665
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm like, I already knew that,
then you didn't nail it.

666
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,140
If I looked at you and

667
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,940
I just don't understand what
you're talking about,

668
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,470
you definitely didn't nail it.

669
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,836
So, practice that unique
insight.

670
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,910
In your two minute pitch,
that's all, you're only

671
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,780
going to get two sentences to
get that out there, so

672
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,860
it can't be complicated, and
that's basically the theme of

673
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,000
this whole thing right, it
cannot be complicated.

674
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,190
Next, how do you make money?

675
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,710
You know, your business model.

676
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,330
I see so many founders run
away from this question

677
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,310
because they think things
like, if I say advertising,

678
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,440
people are going to be like,
oh, that's stupid.

679
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,620
Just say it.

680
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,330
Don't run away.

681
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,430
If it's advertising, say
advertising.

682
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,440
Facebook's a massive
advertising business.

683
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,850
So is Google.

684
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,530
If it's direct sales, it's
direct sales.

685
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,493
If it's you know, a game and

686
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:24,070
you're selling in-app in-app
add ups, like that's fine.

687
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,210
Just say it.

688
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,520
Don't run away from this
sentence.

689
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,580
It only has to be one sentence
long.

690
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,820
Where founders get tricked on
how will you make money is,

691
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,350
they say, well, we're going to
run advertising, maybe some

692
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,880
virtual goods, we're going to
figure out how to do this, and

693
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,170
maybe this, and maybe this.

694
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,650
Well, now you're saying
nothing.

695
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,740
Now you've told me you have no
idea how you

696
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,020
want to monetize this.

697
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,900
This was a checkmark that I
just wanted to write, oh,

698
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,220
they know how they're going to
monetize.

699
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,820
Instead, I'm writing a big
question mark.

700
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,990
So, do the thing that everyone
else in your industry does

701
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,530
to monetize 95% of the time.

702
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,320
Say it and move on.

703
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,720
Like, it's totally okay,

704
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,510
no one's going to hold your
feet to the fire and

705
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,090
say three years later, you
didn't monetize this way.

706
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,240
But it's much better to be
clear and

707
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,670
concise than it is to start
spouting out every single way

708
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,490
your company can make money.

709
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,280
The next one is team.

710
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,160
I think that this answer is
actually really clear.

711
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,970
I think you're trying to do
two things.

712
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,850
If your team has done
something

713
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,088
particularly impressive, you
need to call that out.

714
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,032
We were the founders of
PayPal,

715
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:29,900
probably want to say that.

716
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,454
We were the founders of
Amazon, might,

717
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:32,513
probably want to say that.

718
00:27:32,513 --> 00:27:34,167
So if you guys have done
something that has

719
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,520
made investors money, you want
to say that.

720
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,126
If not, then please don't go
on about the awards your team

721
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,671
has won, or the PhDs or the I
don't care, I don't care.

722
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:46,640
What we want to hear is how
many founders.

723
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,720
Hopefully between two and
four.

724
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,400
What we want to hear is how
many of them are technical.

725
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,830
How many engineers versus
business people?

726
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,600
Hopefully it's 50 50 or more
engineers.

727
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,090
We want to hear is that how
long have you

728
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,220
guys known each other.

729
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,330
We don't want to hear you guys
met at

730
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,607
a founders' dating event three
days ago.

731
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,420
ideally, you've known each
other either personally or

732
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,410
professionally for at least
six months.

733
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,980
We want to hear is that you're
all working full-time.

734
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,200
It's really helpful, we're all
committed to this business.

735
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,920
And what we want to hear is
how you met.

736
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,970
That's it.

737
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,710
You can get in and out of that
two sentences very easy.

738
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,080
Your only way to build
credentials is if

739
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,290
you've accomplished something.

740
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,270
And with an investor typically
it's if you've

741
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,070
accomplished something that's
made someone some money.

742
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,040
So don't try to overinflate
yourself if

743
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,130
you don't have that stat on
your resume, move on.

744
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,030
The more you talk about a bad
thing, the worse it looks.

745
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,140
So, the last one is the big
ask.

746
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,600
When it comes to this and you
have to figure out

747
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,510
whether this is a conversation
involves fundraising or not.

748
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,580
What I tell people is like
this is the time where

749
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,100
you kind of have to know what
you're talking about.

750
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,060
This is a time where you have
to know,

751
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,540
are you raising on a
convertible note?

752
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,550
Are you raising on a safe?

753
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,420
You have to know what the cap
of that safe is.

754
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,200
You have to know how much
money you're raising.

755
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,960
You have to know what the
minimum check size is.

756
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,710
These are things where if you
don't know these these things,

757
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,890
investors going to be like, oh
these guys aren't serious, or

758
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,400
they haven't done their
homework.

759
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,240
So whereas in the rest of

760
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,340
this whole thing you shouldn't
use any jargon.

761
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,280
In this part you shouldn't
just be like, oh,

762
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,930
we're just raising some money.

763
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,990
Like now it's time to

764
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,360
actually use a little bit of
that jargon.

765
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,850
If you don't know that jargon,
Google search it,

766
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,280
like, it's real simple.

767
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,120
You guys will learn it fast.

768
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,150
So, that's it by the way.

769
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,360
That's too, that's all your
pitch.

770
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,247
Done, like, game over.

771
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:37,686
Now you let them talk.

772
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:39,760
So, when to fundraise.

773
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,418
I think this is so important.

774
00:29:42,418 --> 00:29:44,570
Right, you've got this little
Growth graph here.

775
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,810
Investors like to invest based
on traction.

776
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,599
And so literally it's always
better to raise money when

777
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,757
you've got more traction than
less.

778
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,883
Often times though,

779
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:57,081
you guys'll be in a situation
where you're just starting.

780
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,567
Or maybe you just launched.

781
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:02,418
So what you need to do is you
need to think about how do

782
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:04,220
you flip the equation?

783
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,930
Your entire mindset should be,

784
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,770
typically you are the ones
asking investors for

785
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,610
money and therefore they are
strong and you're weak.

786
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,370
How do you create a scenario,

787
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,380
where you are strong and they
are weak?

788
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,370
Right?

789
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,800
That's where you want to be
fundraising.

790
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,430
So first, how do you know that
you're strong?

791
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,990
If investors are asking you to
give you money, you're strong.

792
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,780
That might be a good time to
start fundraising.
