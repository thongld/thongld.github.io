00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:01,805
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQOC-qy-GDY
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,805 --> 00:00:03,219
Thanks for having me, Sam.
I'm Stanley.

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:08,112
I'm the founder of DoorDash
and it's really amazing to

4
00:00:08,112 --> 00:00:12,379
be here because it wasn't
actually that long ago

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:17,080
where I sat in your seats I
was class of 2014.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,632
Graduated in CS, as well as
my co-founder, Andy.

7
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:22,640
And, for those of you who
don't know what Doordash is,

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,456
we're building an on-demand
delivery network for

9
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,930
local cities.

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,730
And I wanna start off with
this photo that I

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,670
took just a few months ago,
and I think

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,070
this was the night when we
just raised our series A.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,080
And I took this photo as I
was walking back

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,480
to where I lived.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,570
I actually lived in Robly at
the time, on campus.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,583
And, I took this photo
because I realized just how

17
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,886
ridiculous the combinations
of things I was holding in

18
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,391
my hand at that time, and

19
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:54,640
I was holding my CS 247
homework.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,660
And then, I had my tax
forms,

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,530
since it was April and I had
to fill out taxes.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,452
And then also that yellow
speeding ticket,

23
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:07,020
and then right below that
was a $15 million

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,740
dollar piece of paper I just
signed from Sequoia.

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,210
And that kind of summarizes
just how ridiculous our

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,060
journey has been, you know,
starting at Stanford.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,260
Doing this while I was at
Stanford, and

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,980
then transitioning this into
an actual startup, and

29
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,740
I want to share that story
with you today.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,590
It all began two years ago,
actually,

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,270
in a macaron store, it was
my junior year at Stanford.

32
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,230
This was fall quarter, and

33
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,370
at that time, I was really
passionate about, you know,

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,850
how do you build technology
for small business owners?

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,100
And I sat down Chloe, the
owner of,

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,932
you know, Chantal Guillon,

37
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:48,470
a macaron store in Palo Alto
at that time.

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,000
Just interviewing her, you
know,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,400
trying to get feedback on
this product prototype we'd

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,010
been working on.

41
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,020
And also just learning
about,

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,870
you know, what her problems
were in general.

43
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,820
And it was during this
meeting when Chloe first

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,902
brought up this problem of
delivery.

45
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:06,580
You know, I remember she
took out this really,

46
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,980
really thick booklet.

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,530
And she showed me pages and
pages of delivery orders.

48
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,510
And a lot of these orders
she had to turn down because

49
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,440
there's no way she could
have fulfilled them,

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,720
as she had no drivers and
she was the one who ended up

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,480
having to personally deliver
all these orders.

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,800
And that was a very
interesting moment for us.

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,260
And then we felt next, over
the next course of,

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,200
over the course of the next
few weeks, we talked to,

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,040
you know, around another
150,

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,760
200 small business owners,
and when we brought up

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,990
this idea of delivery, they
kept, you know, they kept,

58
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,310
you know, agreeing with us,
saying yeah,

59
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,400
this is a really big problem
for us, you know.

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,960
We don't have a delivery
infrastructure.

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,430
It's such a huge pain for
us.

62
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,720
There's not any good
solutions out there.

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,120
And which led us to wonder,
you know,

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,260
delivery is such a common
thing.

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,950
You know, it's such an
obvious thing.

66
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,700
Why hasn't anyone solved
this before, right?

67
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,180
Like, we must be missing
something here.

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,609
So, we thought maybe because
people have tried this in

69
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:05,808
the past, right.

70
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:09,183
But they failed because
there wasn't consumer demand

71
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:09,849
for this.

72
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,297
So we thought, okay, how can
we test this hypothesis?

73
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:16,025
You know, we were just a
bunch of college kids at

74
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:16,716
that time.

75
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,354
You know, we didn't own
trucks or

76
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:21,302
delivery infrastructures, or
anything like that, right.

77
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:25,270
We can't just spin up a
delivery company overnight.

78
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,250
So, how can we test this
assumption we had?

79
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,400
So we decided to create a
simple experiment

80
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,360
with restaurant delivery.

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,630
We spent about an afternoon
just putting

82
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,820
together a really quick
landing page.

83
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,930
And, when I went on the
internet,

84
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,720
I found some PDF menus of,
you know,

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,390
restaurants in Palo Alto
stuck it up there and

86
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,740
then had a phone number at
the bottom, and

87
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,160
which was our personal phone
number, actually.

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,620
And that was it, we put up
the landing page,

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,220
we called it
PaloAltoDelivery.com.

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,930
And this is actually what it
looked like.

91
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,080
You know, super, super, you
know, simple, ugly,

92
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,080
like honestly, we weren't
really expecting anything.

93
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,720
We just launched it.

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,210
And all we wanted to see
was, you know,

95
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,490
would we get phone calls
from this?

96
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,500
And if we got enough phone
calls, then maybe

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,360
this delivery idea was
something worth pursuing.

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,480
So we put it up there,

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,890
we weren't really expecting
anything, and

100
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,790
we were driving back home.

101
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,540
And all of a sudden we got a
phone call, you know?

102
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,240
Someone called, they wanted
to order Thai food.

103
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
And we're like, oh wow, this
is a real order.

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,630
Like, you know,

105
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,392
we have to do something
about it, right?

106
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:45,960
So, so we were in our cars,
and we're, like,

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,160
okay, like, we're not doing
anything right now.

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,890
Might as well just, let's
just swing by, you know,

109
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,360
Siam Royal, pick up some Pad
Thai and

110
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,550
let's just deliver it to
this person, and

111
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,330
let's try to learn how this
whole delivery thing works.

112
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:57,850
And we did.
We

113
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,800
delivered to this guy up in
Alpine Road.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,523
I remember, he told us, I
was asking, oh,

115
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,751
how did you hear about us?

116
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,910
What do you do?

117
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,140
And he told us he was a
scholar.

118
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,740
And then he handed me his
business card, and it

119
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,830
said he was the author of a
book called Weed the People.

120
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,640
And that was like our first
ever delivery, right?

121
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,215
It was like the best
delivery, first

122
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:26,350
delivery/worst delivery you
could have asked for.

123
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,530
You couldn't make this stuff
up.

124
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,630
And, again, in the next day,

125
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,640
we got, you know, two more
phone calls.

126
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,230
But yet, the day after that,
we got five, and

127
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,270
then it became seven, and
then it became ten.

128
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,590
And then, soon, we started
gaining traction on campus

129
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,110
with paloaltodelivery.com
which was pretty crazy.

130
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,910
Because think about it,

131
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,960
right, this was a landing
page.

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,320
You have to look up PDF
menus to place your order,

133
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
and they have to call in.

134
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,580
This isn't exactly the most
professional looking site,

135
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,570
yet people were still, we
kept getting phone calls.

136
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,310
We kept getting orders.

137
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,970
And, that's kind of we knew
we were on to something,

138
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,500
when people were willing.

139
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,280
All right.
We

140
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,880
knew we found a need people
wanted,

141
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,610
when people are willing to
put up with all this.

142
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,930
So I think another key point
to remember is

143
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,330
we launched this in about an
hour, right.

144
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,700
Like we didn't spend, you
know.

145
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,320
We didn't have any drivers.

146
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,520
We didn't have any
algorithms.

147
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,809
We didn't spend, you know.

148
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,610
We didn't have a back-end.

149
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,570
We didn't spend 6 months

150
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,530
building like a fancy
dispatch system.

151
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,800
We didn't have any of that.

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,840
We just launched.

153
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,990
Because at the beginning,

154
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,650
none of that is necessary,
right?

155
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,710
At the beginning, it's all
about testing your idea,

156
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,680
trying to get this thing off
the ground.

157
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,780
And figuring out whether
this was

158
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,640
something people even
wanted.

159
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,560
And it's okay to hack things
together at the beginning.

160
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,610
At YC there's a mantra, we
like to

161
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,860
talk about is doing things
that don't scale.

162
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,540
So at the beginning we were
the delivery drivers.

163
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,140
Now, we would, you know, go
to class and

164
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,260
then after class we'll go,
you know, deliver food.

165
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,860
We were the, you know,
custom support.

166
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,270
Like, I sometimes had to

167
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,660
take phone calls during
lecture.

168
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,430
We spent afternoons just
going down University Avenue

169
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,130
passing out flyers about,
kinda promote DoorDash.

170
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,360
I mean, we didn't have any
dispatch systems.

171
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,030
So what we had to do was,
you know,

172
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,540
we used Square to charge all
of our customers.

173
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,960
We used Google Docs to keep
track of our orders.

174
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,400
we used Apple's Find My
Friends to keep track of

175
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,990
where all of our drivers
were.

176
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,970
You know, stuff like that.

177
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,940
Just figuring out like
what's,

178
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,280
just hacking together
solutions,

179
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,050
just trying to get this
thing off the ground.

180
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,160
In fact, at one point we
were growing so fast that

181
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,810
Square actually shut our
account down because we

182
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,150
were under suspicions for
money laundering.

183
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,440
>> Think about it, we were
getting small chunks of

184
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,290
like $15, $20 orders coming
in at a rapid pace.

185
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,078
It was, yeah.

186
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:06,965
Luckily, my co-founder Tony
worked at Square, so he just

187
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:13,267
e-mailed some buddies there
and everything was solved.

188
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:16,530
>> Yeah, and another thing
about doing

189
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,450
things that don't scale, is
that it also allows you to

190
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,850
become an expert in your
business.

191
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,910
Right?
Like driving,

192
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,230
helps us understand how the
delivery process worked,

193
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,880
you know.

194
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,630
We used that as an
opportunity to talk to

195
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,560
customers, talk to our
restaurants.

196
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,850
We did dispatching which
helped us figure out,

197
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,990
you know, how we manually
dispatched every driver.

198
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,300
And that helped us figure
out, you know,

199
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,290
what our driver assignment
algorithm should look like.

200
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,670
We did customer support
ourselves, you know?

201
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,230
Getting real time feedback
from our customers.

202
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,910
I remember, you know, for

203
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,170
the first few months when we
got started,

204
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,780
we would manually e-mail
every single one of our

205
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,550
new customers.

206
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,930
And at the end of every
night, and

207
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,060
just asking them oh,

208
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,200
how was your first delivery,
how did you hear about us?

209
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,760
And we would personalize all
these e-mails, right?

210
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,610
Like if I see someone order
chicken skewers from

211
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,570
Oren's Hummus, I would say
oh,

212
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,450
like, I love Oren's hummus.

213
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,680
You know, how were your
chicken skewers?

214
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,300
How did the first delivery
went?

215
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
You know, just feedback like
that was really valuable and

216
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,413
customers really, really
appreciated that.

217
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:30,451
And I remember one time,

218
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:35,170
this is during YC, we were
out of, we just came out of

219
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,110
a meeting with one of our
restaurant partners, and,

220
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,310
you know, we wanted, we
heard about this ice

221
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,410
cream store that just opened
up, you know,

222
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,490
on University Avenue, called
Cream, and

223
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,200
we wanted to go try it out.

224
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,410
And then, all of a sudden,
our co founder back at our,

225
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,150
you know, office/house
texted us saying, oh we need

226
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,600
drivers on the road, we, we
got a huge spike and demand.

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,430
So we debated for maybe, you
know,

228
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,490
ten seconds like should we
go get ice cream or

229
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,500
should we go deliver?

230
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,480
Obviously, we went and
delivered.

231
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,490
But that kinda became our
motivation on,

232
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,910
you know, scaling, right.

233
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,080
Like if we can scale then,

234
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,340
you could go get ice cream
next time.

235
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:18,800
So yeah, I think that kinda,
and now,

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,860
of course, we've scaled up
across different cites.

237
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,180
Now you have to worry about
building out

238
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,420
automated solutions and
dispatch systems, and

239
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,720
figuring out how do you
match demand and

240
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,070
supply, and all that fancy
technology stuff.

241
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,280
But none of that mattered at
the beginning.

242
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,130
Because at the beginning,

243
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,490
it's all about getting this
thing off the ground and

244
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,030
trying to find product
market fit.

245
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,010
So, just to summarize.

246
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,220
So the three things I would
say that I learned from

247
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,810
doing DoorDash is first,
test your hypothesis,

248
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,140
you wanna treat your startup
ideas like experiments.

249
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,960
T he second thing is launch
fast.
