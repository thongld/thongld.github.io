00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:06,290

Set the stage with a few
slides and some comments.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,240
But, the main stage is gonna
be with Brian.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,980
When he comes up and

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,556
talks about how he built the
airbnb culture.

5
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,050
So you're here you,

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,210
I've been following the
presentations.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,600
And so, now you know how to
get started.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
You've built a team.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,030
You start to sort of build
your product.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,100
It's off the ground, it's
growing.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,480
People love it, you figured
out how to do that.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,060
You figured out how to
create a very special one of

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,480
a kind company with monopoly
powers that's big,

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,055
and the market that you're
chasing after

15
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:39,870
is slightly bigger than the
paper air plane business so

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,930
you're good, right?

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,120
So, now what?

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,540
So, we're here to submit
that actually culture is

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,340
the thing that's gonna be
very, very important for

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,890
you to be able to scale the
business.

21
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,920
As well as your team.

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,980
And hopefully,

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,620
after this talk you'll be
able to know what,

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,080
what is culture?

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,040
Why does it matter?

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,350
How to sort of create your
core values and think about

27
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,730
elements that sort of fit
together for a core values

28
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,860
in the culture that create a
high performance team.

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,750
And get some best practices
for the culture.

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,420
So, what is culture?

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,620
Anybody have a, wanna take a
guess at what,

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,080
how one should define this?

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,950
>> A set of values
>> Yeah, that's good.

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,550
Did you look that up on the,

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,300
because you had a computer
and Internet connection.

36
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,460
Did you just look it up?

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,420
So these are some
definitions, that,

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,290
you'll find, in, in
Webster's dictionary.

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:32,970
And.

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,910
But that, that.

41
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,592
We're at Stanford.

42
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:37,810
This is kind of a trick
question, it's a CS class.

43
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,900
Questions are never
straightforward.

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,020
The real question is, what
is company culture gonna be?

45
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,510
You know, culture that we
can

46
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,730
generally talk about
society.

47
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,460
About groups.

48
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,250
About places or things.

49
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,030
Here we're talking about
company culture.

50
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,300
And so how do one define
company culture?

51
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,980
We can take the previous
definition and

52
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,500
modify it a little bit.

53
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,280
And so every, this is a hint
of how we may want to

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,650
define company culture.

55
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,590
Everyday blank and blank of
each member of

56
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,850
the team in pursuit of our
company blank.

57
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,820
And some people have filled
these in with different

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,850
sort of things.

59
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,890
A, the first blank could be
assumptions,

60
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,990
beliefs, values.

61
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,720
My favorite is core values.

62
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,430
The second blank for the B
blank.

63
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,040
People have said behaviors.

64
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,470
My favorite, sort of,

65
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,650
answer to that is real
action, how do you act?

66
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,430
And in pursuit of goals,
that's kind of weak.

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,540
in, in, in pursuit of big
and

68
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,070
hairy audacious goals,
that's a little stronger.

69
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,790
But a better definition is
in pursuit of the mission.

70
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,040
So.

71
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,860
Now that, sort of, we have
that definition,

72
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,950
what do we do with it and
why does it matter?

73
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,140
This is a quote from Gandhi,

74
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,990
your beliefs become your
thoughts.

75
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,540
Your thoughts become your
words.

76
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,890
Your words become your
actions.

77
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,060
And your actions become your
habits.

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,020
And your habits become your
values.

79
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,760
Your values become your
destiny.

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,260
If you don't have a good
culture in the company,

81
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,520
you can't pursue your
destiny.

82
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,530
Why it matters is it, it
becomes the first principles

83
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,130
that you sort of go back to
when you make decisions.

84
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,130
It becomes a way to align
people on values that

85
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,010
matter to the company.

86
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,040
It provides a certain level
of

87
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,180
stability to fall back on
and it provides a level of

88
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,610
trust that people can sort
of trust each other with.

89
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,540
It also give you a list of

90
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,160
things that you should be
able to.

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,240
Figure out what to do and
what not to do and what

92
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,450
the more important thing
about that is what not to do

93
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,860
And then finally the other
thing that is important is

94
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,740
it allows you to retain the
right employees.

95
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,350
There are people in this
world that are not gonna be

96
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,830
a fit for your company but
if you have good strong

97
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,120
culture and good strong core
values you'll know who you

98
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,900
wanna retain and who you do
not wanna retain.

99
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,600
And if you took the,

100
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,510
take the first words the
first letter of those it

101
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,090
happens to help you move
faster.

102
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,650
Another reason.

103
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,660
You're thinking that's like
all mushy stuff.

104
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,680
This is actually more
scientific stuff.

105
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,280
So here are indices for,

106
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,430
from 1997 to 2003 of stock
market index of companies.

107
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,280
And the S&P 500 and the
Russell 3000 and

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,760
then for the Fortune 100
best companies to work for.

109
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,800
They survey all these
companies out there and

110
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,420
they've picked out companies
that they

111
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,770
believe are the best
companies to work for.

112
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,730
And, the returns, the stock
market returns of

113
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,020
those companies happens to
be 11.8%, 11.08%,

114
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,160
which is almost twice that
of the other two indices.

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,735
And so, there's real power
in companies that treat

116
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,369
their employees well, where
there is a lot of trust,

117
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,310
where there is a lot of
strong culture.

118
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,190
So, how do you sort of
create a, a set of values,

119
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,080
and, and sort of define the
culture et cetera.

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,300
I get asked that a lot.

121
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,260
You got to start with the
leader of the company,

122
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,430
the founder.

123
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,940
And, so ask yourself, what
are the personal values that

124
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,810
are most important to you?

125
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,580
What are those things that
are most important to

126
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,060
the business?

127
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,130
Who are the types of people
you like working with and

128
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,620
what are their values?

129
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,320
And, through that,

130
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,010
you sort of distill together
what a set of values are.

131
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,350
And think about all the
people that you've

132
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,470
never liked working with,
what values they have.

133
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,330
Think about the opposite of
that, and maybe those should

134
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,820
be considered values for,
for your company.

135
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,689
And, finally, remember this,

136
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,290
the values have to support
your mission.

137
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,110
And, if it doesn't support
your mission,

138
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,570
you're missing something.

139
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,800
And, and then the last,

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,990
final chapter, they have to
be credible and

141
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,410
they have to be uniquely
tied to your mission.

142
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,300
So, at Zappos, in terms of
uniquely applied to

143
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,290
the mission, we're focused
on creating a culture that

144
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,550
was gonna provide great
customer service.

145
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,480
So the first core value we
had was to deliver.

146
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,590
While through service.

147
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,260
We're very specific that we
want to

148
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,740
deliver great customer
service.

149
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,850
And it was gonna be a wild
experience.

150
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,060
And then, below that,

151
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,030
we want to sort of add a
paragraph supporting that.

152
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,710
Talking about exactly what
we mean by that.

153
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,650
We want it to support them,
deliver while through

154
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,340
service, and support people,
such as our employees,

155
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,550
our customers, and our brand
partners, and our investors.

156
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,030
In terms of the opposite
thing, we generally didn't

157
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,820
like working with arrogant
people.

158
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,649
So, one of our core values
that's that was,

159
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,150
was to be humble.

160
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,030
So those are two examples
where we sort of

161
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,600
create a core values in a
way that sort of, sort of,

162
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,700
became credible and uniquely
tied to our mission.

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,210
So, you go through this
process,

164
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,800
you come up with a few core
values.

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,980
These might be some of them.

166
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,840
Whether it's honestly,

167
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,570
integrity, service, teamwork
and they might be a list of,

168
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,570
you might start with three.

169
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,570
You might end up with a list
of ten.

170
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,040
You might list, list of 30.

171
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,490
It's a good start.

172
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,010
And when Zappos went through
this process we started with

173
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,200
like, we asked all the
employees at the time,

174
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,480
what core values they wanna
identify with,

175
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
we came up with 37.

176
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,270
We initially, we sort of
whittled it down to

177
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,900
about ten.

178
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,130
And it took a year to do
this.

179
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,800
That's a long time and you
might wanna ask why.

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,570
Well, if you just come up
with the word honesty,

181
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,400
I mean give me a break
everybody wants

182
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,270
the culture to be honest.

183
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,850
Now you.

184
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,860
Nobody is going to say I
want to be lied to everyday.

185
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,690
service.

186
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,710
What do you mean by service?

187
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,710
There's gotta be a lot more
depth in this than that.

188
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,840
And nobody, everybody talks
about teamwork.

189
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,510
But there's a difference in
level of

190
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,900
team work that you see in a
intramural sports team as

191
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,740
versus a baseball team.

192
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,439
And so how do you sort of
dive deeper into team work.

193
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,660
What are the things that
don't work on for a team?

194
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,450
A lot of it has to do with
communications.

195
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,090
A lot of it has to

196
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,170
do with things that people
have studied.

197
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,200
And you might want to go
deeper into that.

198
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,290
At Zappos we thought about
well there

199
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,390
are a lot of smart people in
this room.

200
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,100
When they're fighting with
each and

201
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,120
trying to figure out whose
right and whose not.

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
It's probably not the best
use of time.

203
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,240
And we want everybody to
sort of riff off each other

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,920
and help each other make any
idea better.

205
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,350
The result is that the
company gets a better idea,

206
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,540
not that any individual
person is right.

207
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,130
So we wanted to instill this
idea that

208
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,410
it's company first,

209
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,230
then your department, then
your team, then yourself.

210
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,228
And how do you do that?

211
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:23,690
Gonna go a, ano, a level a
little deeper than that.

212
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,290
There's another,

213
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,280
there's a great sort of sort
of element of

214
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,460
high performing teams that I
really like which is this

215
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,090
pyramid that was created by
Patrick Lencioni and

216
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,460
he wrote this book The Five
Dysfunctions of a Team and

217
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,810
the reason this is
interesting is he

218
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,440
talks about the breakdowns
of a teams.

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,060
First of all if you don't.

220
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,620
A lot of teams break down
because they don't have

221
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,730
any trust.

222
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,800
Then, even if you had trust,
why do you need trust?

223
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,850
Well, then if you have trust
you can actually have

224
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,738
debates and conflict and get
to the right answer.

225
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:58,570
If you don't have conflict
and debate, people are just,

226
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,910
it's the blind leading the
blind.

227
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,340
How do you know you actually
got to

228
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,730
the right answer before you
sort of commit to something?

229
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,470
So, people are not actually
willing to commit.

230
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,680
They're afraid of
committing.

231
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,870
And so let's say you get to
the next level and

232
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,900
you are actually able to
commit.

233
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,010
Well what, what goes wrong
then?

234
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,920
It's usually because people
are not held accountable to

235
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,830
things that they committed
to?

236
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,050
And if people are not held
accountable to the things

237
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,130
that they've committed to,
then they can't get results.

238
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,980
And I would submit to you,

239
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,660
if you think about the
company as a black box,

240
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,460
and results, whether it's
financial,

241
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,300
whether you produce a great
product,

242
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,000
or anything like that as the
output.

243
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,020
One of the major inputs is
the culture of the company.

244
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,710
So some other best practices
we're gonna actually talk

245
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,290
about during Q and A because
I think this is gonna blend

246
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,920
into the conversation is
that you want to incorporate

247
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,500
your mission to values we've
talked about that.

248
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,310
Performance, you gotta think
harder,

249
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,500
deeper, longer about your
values than

250
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,170
you might initially think
you need to do.

251
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,700
One of the things I think
that a lot of

252
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,720
companies don't actually do
is they interview for

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,250
a technical fit or skill fit
or competency in that realm.

254
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,960
But they don't actually
interview for

255
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,730
the culture fit, and

256
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,890
whether someone will
actually believe and

257
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,750
follow the mission.

258
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,000
I think that's a big, big
no-no.

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,140
Like I think you can have
the smartest engineer in

260
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,380
the world but, if they don't
believe in their mission.

261
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,120
They're not gonna put their,
pour their heart and

262
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,700
soul into it.

263
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,330
And that's one of the things
that where, if you actually

264
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,650
sorta start thinking about
culture from the interview

265
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,440
process to performance
reviews to making sure that

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,920
it's a daily habit, you'll
get a lot further with

267
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,970
produ, with, making a great
culture.

268
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,290
The finally point on making
it, a daily habit, I think.

269
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,500
Culture, just like customer
service or

270
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,110
fitness, is like mother had
an apple pie.

271
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,270
Everybody wants to provide
great customer service.

272
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,480
Every company wants to have
a great culture.

273
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,440
What they fail to do is make
it a daily habit.

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
You just can't be fit if
your,

275
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,010
if you don't do it as a
daily habit.

276
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,560
Eventually you get out of
shape,

277
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,570
then you get fat, and then
you're like, oh,

278
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,480
I got to go on a crash diet
to sort of

279
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,550
get back into shape.

280
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,650
That doesn't quite work.

281
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,920
And the same is true with
something like culture.

282
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,660
So I think we checked all of
these off,

283
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,870
so we can go into Q and A
with Brian.

284
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,380
>> All right.
Cool.

285
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,380
>> Yeah, that's good.

286
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,540
>> All right.
Hello, everybody.

287
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,180
It's quiet in here, I'll be
honest.

288
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,880
Now it's better.

289
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,560
Now, I feel less on edge.

290
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,500
Nothing worst than a room
full of people really,

291
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,260
really quiet, staring at
you, but now I feel better.

292
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,570
>> I'd say it for five, ten
minutes.

293
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,980
>> Yeah.
>> You could bare for

294
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,430
a little longer.

295
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,300
So Brian.

296
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,580
Talk about how the process
by which you came to
