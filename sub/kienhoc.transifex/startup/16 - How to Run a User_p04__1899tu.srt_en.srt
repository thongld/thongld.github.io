736
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,880
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk
pursuing this gaming
broadcasting thing.

737
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,900
And, they talked a lot about
video stability.

738
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,410
Our service wasn't good in
Europe specifically but, but

739
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,840
just globally, video stability
is this huge,

740
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,490
huge issue for them.

741
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,080
And if you compare and

742
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,000
contrast actually, it was
really different.

743
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Like, the things that people
who

744
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,830
didn't use our service said
about what they cared about,

745
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,670
was completely different from
the things that people who

746
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,400
were using the service cared
about.

747
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,100
And we focused on this stuff
because this was

748
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,000
the stuff where, it was so bad
that they

749
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,730
weren't even willing to use
our service because of it.

750
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,750
And most of

751
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,680
them actually had thought
about this because we were,

752
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,090
our user base happened to be a
very well educated user base

753
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,330
in the area who knew about all
their options for, for this.

754
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,840
And, they would, they
actually, you know,

755
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,610
reaching out to them meant
they could,

756
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,290
they probably already tried
all four services and

757
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,990
actually had an opinion.

758
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,780
It's great when you can users
who are that,

759
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,920
that informed and that,

760
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,810
that, they have understand the
space that well.

761
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,290
And and if you go to the.

762
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,791
I'm just going to go to the
next slide.

763
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,520
Yeah.

764
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,500
Here we go.

765
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,780
The other big thing we did
that I thought was

766
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,210
really important was we talked
to non-broadcasters.

767
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,140
so, we went up there and

768
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,860
we talked to all the people
who weren't using us

769
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,040
or competitors.

770
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,720
And in many ways,

771
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,960
those are the most important
people, right?

772
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,970
Talking to your competitor's,

773
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,320
that's your short term win,
right?

774
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,440
Someones using a competing,
piece of competing software

775
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,270
unless your piece of competing
software is something like

776
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,900
Google, which is a search
engine, which everyone uses,.

777
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,480
Okay.
Then,

778
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,460
there are no non-users to
convert.

779
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,840
But, in the case of gaming
broadcasting,

780
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,360
almost everyone's a non-user,
right?

781
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,660
The, the majority, this is
true for most new products.

782
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,210
The majority of people you're
computing with are non-users.

783
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,330
They are people who have never
used your service before.

784
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,960
And, what they say is actually
the most important.

785
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,090
What they say is, is the thing
that blocks you from expanding

786
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,870
from a, a, expanding the size
of

787
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,420
the market with your features,
right?

788
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,090
If you, all you do is look at
your competitors and

789
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,780
yourself, and all you do is
talk to your,

790
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,620
you know, your people who use
your competitors products.

791
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,920
People who use your products.

792
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,610
You can never expand.

793
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,220
Well, not never.

794
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,220
But, you're not learning the
things that help you

795
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,840
expand the size of the market.

796
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,720
You want to talk to people who
aren't even trying to use

797
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,870
one of these things, yet.

798
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,920
Who, who have thought about
it, maybe.

799
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,430
But, who aren't who aren't
into it.

800
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,960
So, what did they say?

801
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,920
My computer isn't fast enough.

802
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,430
I'm focused on training 12
hours a day for

803
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,100
the next tournament.

804
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,230
I like making the perfect
video, and like, editing it.

805
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,320
And so, I just upload things
to YouTube.

806
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,150
I don't do live streaming.

807
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,750
I don't, I, I, I have no
desire to,

808
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,650
to go into that space.

809
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,240
or, or this is actually,

810
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,270
particularly in Korea, this is
a big problem.

811
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,010
Once our strategy gets
broadcast in

812
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,620
a major tournament, we have to
start over.

813
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,770
We have to like, come up with
an entirely new strategy.

814
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,890
And so, the last thing we
ever'd want to do would be

815
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,134
broadcast our practice
sessions, are you crazy?

816
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,284
That's going to hurt us in the
next big tournament.

817
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:25,113
And so, this became,

818
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:26,511
this became a big outreach
program for

819
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,621
us, trying to figure out how
we can get people over this.

820
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:30,055
We bought people computers.

821
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,661
We ,.

822
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,021
We worked really closely with
gaming broadcast,

823
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,714
software companies to help,
the who,

824
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:38,880
who made the broadcasting
software to make that better.

825
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,970
We started building
broadcasting into games and

826
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,730
into platforms, like we built
broadcasting into the Xbox,

827
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,510
we built broadcasting into the
Playstation 4.

828
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,050
Because we wanted,

829
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,450
needed to overcome this issue
that, like,

830
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,440
it was too hard, broadcasting
wasn't, wasn't possible.

831
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,380
And so you sort of combine
these, for us, these

832
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,460
are three, three big groups we
looked at for broadcasting.

833
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,390
And you combine that feedback
and

834
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,080
what it tells you is not the
features to build.

835
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,470
Right?
Because the, the features they

836
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,370
asked for things like polls
things like

837
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,860
a you know, the ability to
have child account.

838
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,600
Like, child accounts in your
account.

839
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,769
We haven't built most of that
stuff.

840
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,150
But what was important were
the, were the, the issues,

841
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,180
like the goals they were
trying to accomplish there.

842
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,130
People wanted money.

843
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,550
People wanted stability and
quality.

844
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,150
People wanted universal access
for

845
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,420
viewers all around the world
to be able to watch them.

846
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,470
And so that became our focus,
actually.

847
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,560
And we dumped almost all of
our resources into things that

848
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,370
none, no one ever mentioned in
an interview.

849
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,990
But, those are the things that
actually address the problem.

850
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,520
And, and the way you could
tell that it worked is, was as

851
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,410
we, we would build these
things, and then we would go

852
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,730
back to this exact same people
we interviewed and say hey,

853
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,540
you told us you really cared a
lot about making money.

854
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,720
Well, we built you this
subscription program,

855
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,180
that will let you make money.

856
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,550
And, it, it, it's astonishing
because most people aren't,

857
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,940
have never had that
experience, actually.

858
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,030
They've never talked to
someone and

859
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,140
said it would be really great
if your product had feature X.

860
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,960
And then, and then, like, two
months later or

861
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,160
a month later, your product
actually has feature X.

862
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,750
Or at the very least,

863
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,420
a feature that addresses the
problem they brought up.

864
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,830
And so, it was actually, the,

865
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,280
the people we converted first
to our

866
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,170
product are the people that we
talk to about user research.

867
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,420
They are the ones who were
actually the most impressed,

868
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,640
which is kind of fun.

869
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,110
But it really worked, because
those,

870
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,490
we picked people who are
representative.

871
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,290
We picked big broadcasters,
small ones, medium ones.

872
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,300
And we, we made sure we were
addressing their concerns.

873
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,000
And that, that was completely
different from how we'd

874
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,130
approach the problem on
JustinTV.

875
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,470
Because in JustinTV, when we'd
try to do this,

876
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,190
we'd, we'd sat down.

877
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,930
We trolled through huge
amounts of data.

878
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,630
Like we, we spent tons of time
looking at Google Analytics.

879
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,600
Looking at mixed panel.

880
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,820
Looking at in-house analytics
tools.

881
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,470
Figuring out how people use
the service.

882
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,950
Looking at where our traffic
came from.

883
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,550
Completion rates on flows.

884
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,930
We spent all this time doing
that.

885
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,880
And that's good, I mean, you
can learn things from that.

886
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm not telling you not to
look at your at your data.

887
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,790
But it doesn't tell you where
you need to go.

888
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,700
It doesn't tell you where,

889
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,880
what the problems are you need
to address.

890
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,800
And so we would just sort of
invent these ideas in

891
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,900
JustinTV.

892
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,180
And then, nine times out of
ten,

893
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,600
without talking to someone,
the idea turns out to be bad.

894
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,420
And that's just one of those
disappointing things about

895
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,150
doing user interviews and user
feedback.

896
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,060
It's why, I think, so many
people don't do it, which is,

897
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,270
you're going to get negative
news about your,

898
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,830
your favorite pet feature most
of the time.

899
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,570
Like, you're going to have
this great idea,

900
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,510
and you're going to talk to
the user, and it's going to

901
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,150
turn out that that nobody
actually wants that.

902
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,070
Like no, no one's actually,
they're actually completely

903
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,410
concerned about completely
different things and

904
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,790
they don't care about what you
thought was important at all.

905
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,790
And and that's a little bit
sad but just, just think about

906
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,790
how sad you'd be in four
months when you launched that

907
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,280
feature and it turns out no
one actually wants to use it.

908
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,960
So think that's about it for

909
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,290
my the lecture section of what
we're we're talking about.

910
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,260
I want to take some questions
from the audience.

911
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,340
>> What you see startups get
most wrong about?

912
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,090
I mean, most startups don't do
them at all, but

913
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,560
the ones that do what are the
most common mistakes?

914
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,670
>> I'd say, the most common
mistakes are,

915
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,230
showing people your product.

916
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,820
don't, don't show them you're
product.

917
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,350
It's, it's sort of like
telling them about a feature,

918
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,410
you want to learn about what's
already in their heads, your,

919
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,480
you want to avoid putting
things there.

920
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,850
The other thing is, asking
about your,

921
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,310
your pet feature direction, so
if you think you want to add,

922
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,440
add subscriptions to your
product.

923
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,430
Going and asking people would
you pay for a subscription.

924
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,980
Going and asking them, would
you use this feature.

925
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,820
And I'd say the the other big
mistake people make is

926
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,620
talking to who's available
rather than talking to

927
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,850
who they need to talk to.

928
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,544
There's certain users that are
really easy to get at,

929
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:49,617
because they are say, members
of your forum already.

930
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,320
Right?
You have some product forum,

931
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,680
and you talk to the users on
that forum because they're,

932
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,750
they're easier to get access
to.

933
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,130
we, we spent like weeks
digging for

934
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,090
identity information, and

935
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,350
figuring who these people
were.

936
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,520
So we could contact them, so
we could talk to them.

937
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
Because a lot of these people
weren't, it wasn't obvious.

938
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,260
They were just some user on a,
on a site.

939
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,390
And if that site didn't
support messaging, there was,

940
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,880
like, no obvious way to
interact with them.

941
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,140
And so we spent a bunch of
time trying to network, and

942
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,930
find those users, and bring
them on.

943
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,760
Because if you, if you just
talk to who's easy to talk to,

944
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,570
you're not really getting,
getting the best data.

945
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,760
The fortunate side there is
that almost everyone is

946
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,704
flattered to be asked what
they think.

947
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:30,082
And so most of them will
actually talk to you and

948
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:31,268
tell you things.

949
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:32,140
Yeah?

950
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,690
>> How hard is it to

951
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,180
get buy in from the rest of
your company?

952
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,120
I mean, like, you can go and

953
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,140
be like, whatever, I'm in
charge.

954
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,300
So you're doing what I say.

955
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,395
But it's probably not the best
way of doing it.

956
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:42,270
>> Mm-hm.
>> So how did you get them to?

957
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,280
>> That's a good question.

958
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,180
So the question is how hard is
it to get buy in

959
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,380
from the rest of the company
and how do you do it?

960
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,960
Getting buy in if you just go
to them and

961
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,380
say, I figured out, I talked
to the user,

962
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,860
I figured it out we have to
build this.

963
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,340
Is really hard.

964
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,410
Because people don't trust
you.

965
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,980
There's something magic about
showing them in

966
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,600
the interview though.

967
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,990
So I really recommend you
record interviews.

968
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,340
Recording interviews is like
magic.

969
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
A, it stops you from taking
notes in the middle.

970
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,850
And taking notes is a little
bit disruptive.

971
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,120
It makes it harder for you to

972
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,400
feel like you're actually
engaged in the conversation.

973
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,710
And b, you can then play that
recording for people.

974
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,670
So when, when they don't have
to be there for

975
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,550
the entirety of all of the
interviews.

976
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,830
But when you want to make a
point about what,

977
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,368
what we should be building and
why.

978
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:24,380
You just playback for the rest
of the company that interview

979
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,040
and it's it's like magic the
influence it has on people's

980
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,420
thoughts and what's what the
right thing to build is.
