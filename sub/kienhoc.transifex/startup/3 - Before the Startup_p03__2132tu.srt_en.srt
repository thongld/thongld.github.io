595
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,000

last counter-intuitive
point.

596
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,870
The way to get startup
ideas,

597
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,370
is not to try to think of
startup ideas.

598
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,940
I've written a whole essay
on this and

599
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm not gonna repeat the
whole thing here.

600
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,180
But the short version is
that if you make

601
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,180
a conscious effort to try
and think of startup ideas,

602
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,200
you will think of ideas that
are not only bad, but

603
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,080
bad and plausible sounding.

604
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,310
Meaning you and everybody
else will be fooled by them,

605
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,200
and you'll waste a lot of

606
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,730
time before realizing
they're no good.

607
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,290
The way to come up with good
startup ideas is

608
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,380
to take a step back.

609
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,655
Instead of trying to make a
conscious effort to think of

610
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:17,480
startup ideas, turn your
brain into the type that

611
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,480
has startup ideas
unconsciously.

612
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,120
In fact, so

613
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,900
unconsciously that you don't
even realize at first that

614
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,920
they're startup ideas.

615
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,720
This is not only possible,
Yahoo, Google, Facebook, and

616
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,920
Apple all got started this
way.

617
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,610
None of these companies were
even supposed to be

618
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,210
companies at first, they
were all just side projects.

619
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,060
The very best ideas almost
have to

620
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,540
start as side projects,
because they're always such

621
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,860
outliers that your conscious
mind would reject.

622
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,260
As ideas for companies.

623
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,180
Okay?

624
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,280
So, how do you turn your
mind into the kind that

625
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,310
has startup ideas
unconsciously?

626
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,500
1, learn about things that
matter.

627
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,630
2, work on problems that
interest you.

628
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,240
3, with people you like and
respect.

629
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,830
That third part incidentally
is

630
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,660
how you get co-founders at
the same time as the idea.

631
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,880
The first time I wrote that
paragraph,

632
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,570
instead of learn a lot about
things that matter,

633
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,620
I wrote become good at some
technology.

634
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,530
But that prescription,
though sufficient,

635
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,150
is too narrow.

636
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,560
What was special about Brian
Chesky and Joe Gebbia from

637
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,390
Airbnb was not they were
experts in technology.

638
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,110
They went to art school.

639
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,740
They were experts in design,
and

640
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,720
perhaps even more
importantly,

641
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,010
they were really good at
organizing people and

642
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,670
getting projects done.

643
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,140
So, you don't have to work
on technology per se, so

644
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,380
long as you work on things
that stretch you.

645
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,170
What kind of things are
those?

646
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,470
Now, that is very hard to
answer in the general case.

647
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,080
History is full of examples
of young people who

648
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,090
were working on problems
that no one else,

649
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,680
at the time, thought were
important.

650
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,160
And in particular that their
parents didn't think they

651
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,090
were important.

652
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,730
On the other hand, history
is even fuller

653
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,640
of examples of parents who
thought their kids were

654
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,720
wasting their time, and who
were right, so.

655
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,270
>> How do you know if you're
working on real stuff?

656
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,230
I mean when Twitch TV
switched from being

657
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,760
Justin Dot TV to Twitch TV,
and

658
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,840
they were gonna broadcast
people playing video games,

659
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,010
I was like what?

660
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,660
But, turned out to be a good
business.

661
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,110
Well, I know,

662
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,700
I know how I know, real
problems are interesting.

663
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,930
And I'm self-indulgent.

664
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,180
I like, I'm always
interested in

665
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,800
working on interesting
things even if

666
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,950
no one else cares about
them.

667
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,990
And I find it very hard to
make myself work on boring

668
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,420
things even if they're
supposed to be important.

669
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
My life is full of case
after case where I

670
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,710
worked on things just cuz I
was interested.

671
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,660
And they turned out to be

672
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,205
useful later in some worldly
way.

673
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:57,350
Y Combinator itself is
something I

674
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,340
only did because it seemed
interesting.

675
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,060
So, I seem to

676
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,880
have some sort of internal
compass that helps me out.

677
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,990
But, this is, for you, not
me and

678
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,300
I don't know what you have
in your heads.

679
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,510
Maybe if I think more about
it I could come up with some

680
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,020
heuristics for recognizing
genuinely interesting ideas.

681
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,300
But for now, all I can give
you is the hopelessly

682
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,250
question begging advice,
incidentally,

683
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,590
this is the actual meaning
of the phrase,

684
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,660
begging the question.

685
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,820
The hopelessly question
begging advice that if

686
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,910
you're interested in
genuinely interesting

687
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,010
problems, gratifying your
interest energetically is

688
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,680
the best way to prepare
yourself for a start-up.

689
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,490
And, for that matter,

690
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,740
probably the best way to
live.

691
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,100
But although I can't explain
in

692
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,880
the general case what counts
as an interesting problem,

693
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
I can tell you about a large
subset of them.

694
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,980
If you think of technology
as something

695
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,300
that's spreading like a sort
of fractal stain,

696
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,640
every point on the edge
that's moving,

697
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,358
represents an interesting
problem.

698
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,460
Steam engines is not so

699
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,490
much, although maybe, you
never know.

700
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,750
So, one guaranteed way to
turn your mind into the type

701
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,340
that startup ideas form in
unconsciously is to

702
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,680
get yourself to the leading
edge of some technology, to,

703
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,500
as Paul Buchheit put it,
live in the future.

704
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,250
And when you get there,
ideas that seem uncannily

705
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,620
prescient to some people
will seem obvious to you.

706
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,030
You may not realize they're
startup ideas, but you'll

707
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,300
know they're something that
ought to exist.

708
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,900
For example, back at
Harvard,

709
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,520
back in the mid 90s,

710
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,980
a fellow grad student of my
friends Robert and

711
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,670
Trevor, wrote his own
voiceover IP software.

712
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,280
It wasn't meant to be a
startup.

713
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,880
He never tried to turn it
into one.

714
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,630
He just wanted to talk to
his girlfriend in

715
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,210
Taiwan without paying for
long distance calls.

716
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,870
And since he was an expert
on networks,

717
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,050
it seemed obvious to him
that the thing to do was to

718
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,850
turn the sound into packets
and

719
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,730
ship them over the Internet
for free.

720
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,840
Why didn't everybody do
this?

721
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,492
Well because they weren't
good at writing that kind

722
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:58,492
of software.

723
00:29:58,492 --> 00:29:59,770
He never did anything with
this.

724
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,281
He never tried to turn it
into a startup.

725
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:05,683
But that is how all the best
startups tend to happen.

726
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:08,858
So, strangely enough, the
optimal thing to do in

727
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:12,335
college if you wanna be a
successful startup founder,

728
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:15,132
is not some sort of new
vocational version of

729
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:18,160
college focused on
entrepreneurship.

730
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,980
It’s the classic version of
college as education for

731
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,629
its own sake.

732
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,550
If you wanna start a
startup, what you

733
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,810
should do in college is
learn powerful things.

734
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,590
And if you have genuine
intellectual curiosity,

735
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,130
that's what you'll naturally
tend to

736
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,760
do if you just follow your
own inclinations.

737
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,210
The component of
entrepreneurship,

738
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,590
I can never quite say that
word with a straight face,

739
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,960
that really matters is
domain expertise.

740
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,460
Larry Page is Larry Page cuz
he was an expert on search.

741
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,226
And the way he became an
expert on search,

742
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,244
was because he was genuinely
interested in it,

743
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:54,865
not because of some ulterior
motive.

744
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:55,761
At its best,

745
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:59,265
starting a startup is merely
an ulterior motive for

746
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:02,607
curiosity and you'll do it
best if you introduce

747
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,799
the ulterior motive at the
end of the process.

748
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,849
So here, is the ultimate
advice for young would-be

749
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,000
startup founders reduced to
two words, just learn.

750
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:16,352
All right, how much time do
we have left?

751
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,873
>> 18 minutes.

752
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:20,358
>> 18 minutes of questions,
good god,

753
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:22,840
do you guys have the
questions?

754
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,509
>> Sure, we’ll start with,
two questions online or

755
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,882
we can start with others.

756
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:28,813
>> You guys are in charge,
whatever you wanna do.

757
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:32,730
>> Okay.

758
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,210
So, to start with, online
questions.

759
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,040
The most voted question
today was-

760
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,700
>> Do I have to repeat them,
by the way?

761
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,257
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

762
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:42,267
>> How can a non-technical
founder most

763
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,350
effectively contribute to a
startup?

764
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,092
>> How can a non-technical
founder most

765
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,895
effectively contribute to a
startup?

766
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,064
Well, if the startup is,

767
00:31:51,064 --> 00:31:54,481
if the startup is working in
some domain.

768
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:57,358
If it's not a pure
technology startup, but

769
00:31:57,358 --> 00:32:00,546
is working in some very
specific domain, like,

770
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,590
if it's Uber, right?

771
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,873
And the, and the
non-technical founder was

772
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,854
an expert in the limo
business, then,

773
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:09,799
actually, the non-technical
founder would probably be

774
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,201
doing most of the work,
recruiting drivers and

775
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:14,440
doing whatever else Uber has
to do, right?

776
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,307
And the technical founder
will be just writing

777
00:32:17,307 --> 00:32:20,761
the iPhone app, which is
probably less, well, iPhone

778
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:24,240
and Android app, hm, which
is less than half of it.

779
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,551
If it's a purely technology
startup, the,

780
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:30,611
the non-technical founder
does sales.

781
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:31,835
And brings coffee and

782
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:33,879
cheeseburgers to the
programmer.

783
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:36,652
>> Okay, next.

784
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:39,380
>> Oh, audience?

785
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,590
Okay, audience, yes?

786
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,910
>> Do you see,

787
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:47,330
any value in business school
for people who want to

788
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,025
pursue entrepreneur,
entrepreneurship?

789
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,240
>> Do I see any value in.

790
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,530
>> Or, if so, what value, I
guess?

791
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,735
I'm hoping that's not.

792
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:54,303
>> Well, we probably won't
have to get to

793
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:55,213
the second question.

794
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,427
>> Which I suppose is the
answer to

795
00:32:58,427 --> 00:32:59,360
your first question.

796
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,370
Okay, so the question is, is
there any value in business

797
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,600
school if you're interested
in entrepreneurship?

798
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,440
And, if so, what?

799
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,980
So, basically, no.

800
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,602
I mean, it sounds
undiplomatic, but

801
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:15,240
the point, what business
school was designed for

802
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,650
is to teach people
management, right?

803
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,290
And management is a problem
that you only have in

804
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,530
a startup if you're
sufficiently successful.

805
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,388
So, really,

806
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:28,185
what you need to, what you
need to know early on to

807
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:31,600
make a startup successful,
is developing products.

808
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,760
You'd be better off going to
design school,

809
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,850
if you want to go to some
sort of school.

810
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,620
Although frankly,

811
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,800
the way to learn how to do
it is just to do it,

812
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,160
you know?

813
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,740
One of the things I got
wrong early on,

814
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,190
is that I advised people who
were interested in starting

815
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,680
a startup to go work for
some other company for

816
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
a few years before starting
their own.

817
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,300
But, honestly, the best way
to learn how to

818
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,080
start a startup is to try
and start it.

819
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,120
You may not be successful,
but

820
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,895
you'll learn faster if you
just do it.

821
00:33:56,895 --> 00:33:59,390
So, not really.

822
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,100
Business schools are trying
really hard to do this, but

823
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,900
honestly, like, they were,
they were designed to

824
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,540
train the officer corps of
large companies, right?

825
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,232
Which is what business
seemed to be,

826
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:14,688
back when it was a choice of
either the officer corps of

827
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:17,030
large companies or Joe's
Shoe Store.

828
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,550
And then, then there was
this new thing, Apple,

829
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,070
which started out as small
as Joe's Shoe Store and

830
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,150
then, like, turns into this
giant mega-company.

831
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,220
But they weren't designed
for that world.

832
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,112
And, like, they're good at
what they're good at,

833
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,247
they should just be, do that
and

834
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:31,807
screw this whole
entrepreneurship thing,

835
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:33,390
just cuz it's cool.

836
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,240
Yes?
>> You said, management

837
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,850
is a problem that you have
only when you're successful.

838
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,220
>> Yes.
>> So what about those first

839
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,520
two or three people as

840
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,510
a founder that you're trying
to manage?

841
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,720
>> Okay, so management is a
problem only if

842
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,910
you're successful.

843
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,960
What about those first two
or three people?

844
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,320
Well, ideally, you're
successful before you

845
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,270
even hire two or three
people, right?

846
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,380
Didn't you say, Sam, that
Airbnb took five months to

847
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,318
hire their first employee?

848
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:02,340
So ideally, you don't have
even two or

849
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,440
three people for quite a
while.

850
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,008
When you do, you can, you
can sort of, the,

851
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:15,780
the first hires in a startup
are almost like founders.

852
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,500
They should be motivated by
the same things.

853
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,750
They can't be people, they
can't be people you have to,

854
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,750
like, manage, right?

855
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,380
This is like that, this is
not, like, The Office or

856
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,280
something like that.

857
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,670
These are your, these have
to be your peers, really.

858
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,180
You shouldn't have to manage
them much.

859
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,040
>> So it's just a big no-no,
like if someone has to

860
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,080
be managed, no way they can
be on the founding team?

861
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,200
>> Well, never say never.

862
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,350
I should repeat all these
questions, so

863
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,460
if someone has to manage,

864
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,570
no way they should be on the
founding team?

865
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,115
In, in the case where you're
doing something where you

866
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:52,369
need some sort of super
advanced technical thing.

867
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,437
And there's some boffin, if
you know that word,

868
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:58,431
who knows this thing and
nothing else in the world

869
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,933
including, like how to wipe
his mouth.

870
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:04,074
Then it may be to your
advantage to hire said

871
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:07,300
boffin and wipe his mouth
for him.

872
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,008
But.

873
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:09,724
>> Okay.

874
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:12,980
>> As a general rule, you
want people who are,

875
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,620
sort of self-motivated early
on.

876
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,340
They should be just like
founders.

877
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,120
Yes, questions?

878
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,280
In the far back?

879
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,310
>> Do you think we're
currently in a bubble?

880
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,860
>> Do I think we're
currently in a bubble?

881
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:32,620
Okay, so I'll give you two
answers to this question.

882
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,775
One, ask me questions that
are useful to this audience,

883
00:36:35,775 --> 00:36:37,260
cuz these people are here to
learn how to

884
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,120
start startups and I have in
my head, like,

885
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,080
more data about that than
anybody else.

886
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,890
And you're asking me the
kind of questions a reporter

887
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,864
does cuz they can't think of
anything interesting to ask.

888
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:48,970
But I will answer your
question.

889
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,990
There is a difference
between prices merely being

890
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,280
high and a bubble.

891
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,720
A bubble is a very specific
form of prices being high,
