505
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,160
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVfnkM44Urs
best in the world, at
whatever they do.

506
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,330
Mark Zuckerberg once said
uh,

507
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,090
that he tries to hire
people, that A,

508
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,510
that he would spend time
with socially and B,

509
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,650
that he'd be comfortable
reporting to,

510
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,610
if the roles were reversed.

511
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,730
Um, this strikes me as a
very good framework.

512
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,830
You don't have to be friends
with everybody,

513
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,900
but you should at least
enjoy working with them.

514
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,640
And if you can't have that,

515
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,962
you need to at least deeply
respect them.

516
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:34,220
Um, but again, the,

517
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,675
if you don't wanna spend a
lot of time around people,

518
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,990
uh, you should sort of trust
your instincts on that.

519
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,170
While I'm on this topic of
hiring uh,

520
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,500
I want to talk about
employee equity.

521
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,090
Founders screw this up all
the time.

522
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,780
Um, I think that as a rough
guideline you should aim to

523
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,590
give 10% of the company to
the first ten employees.

524
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,680
Um, they have to earn it
over four years anyway.

525
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,650
And if they're successful,

526
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,050
they're gonna contribute way
more than that.

527
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,930
Uh, they're gonna increase
the value of

528
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,610
the company by way more than
that.

529
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,440
Um, and if not, then they
won't be around anyway.

530
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,860
So for whatever reason
founders are usually

531
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,220
very stingy with equity to
employees and

532
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,330
very generous with equity to
investors.

533
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,490
And I think this is totally
backwards, um,

534
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,370
I think this is one of the
things founders screw up

535
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,490
the most often.

536
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,340
You know, employees will
only add more

537
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,640
value over time.

538
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,470
Investors sort of like write
the check, and

539
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,910
then despite a lot of big
promises,

540
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,160
don't usually do that much.

541
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,340
Sometimes they do.

542
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,980
Um, but, but your employees
are really the ones that

543
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,160
build the company over years
and years.

544
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,550
So I believe in like
fighting with investors to

545
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,320
reduce the amount of equity
they get.

546
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,670
Um, and then being as gen,

547
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,440
generous as you possibly can
with employees.

548
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,149
Um, the YC companies that
have done this well,

549
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,064
the YC companies that have
been super generous with

550
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:51,113
equity to early employees in
general are the most

551
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,248
succesful ones that we've
funded.

552
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:56,409
Um, all right.

553
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,591
So one thing that founders
forget is that after they

554
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,959
ah, after that they hire
employees,

555
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,593
they have to retain them.

556
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,728
I'm not gonna go into a huge
amount of detail here,

557
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,873
cuz we're gonna have a full
lecture on this later.

558
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,108
Um, but I do wanna talk
about it a little bit.

559
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,026
Because founders get this
wrong so often.

560
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:14,125
Um, you have to make

561
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,990
sure that your employees are
happy and feel valued.

562
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,541
This is one of

563
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,707
the reasons that big equity
grants are important.

564
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:21,003
Um, people in the excitement
of

565
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,400
joining a startup don't
think about it much.

566
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,710
But if they come in day
after day, year after year,

567
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,910
um if they feel like they've
been treated unfairly,

568
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,140
that will really start to
grate on them,

569
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,790
uh, and resentment will
build.

570
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,690
But more than that,

571
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,040
learning just a little bit
of management skill,

572
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,810
which first time CEOs are
usually terrible at,

573
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,330
uh, goes a long way.

574
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,280
Um, one of the speakers at
YC this summer, uh, who,

575
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,780
who is not extremely
successful.

576
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,590
But struggled early on and

577
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,930
had his team turn over a few
times.

578
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,069
Someone asked him what his
biggest learning was.

579
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,201
And he said that it turns
out you shouldn't tell your

580
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,848
employees they're fucking up
every day

581
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:56,133
unless you'd like them all
to leave because they will.

582
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:57,076
>> Laugh.

583
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:58,594
>> Um, but as a founder this
is

584
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:01,230
this like very natural
instinct, right?

585
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,910
You think you can do
everything the best?

586
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,770
And, it's easy to

587
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,690
tell people when they're not
doing it well.

588
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,520
So, learning just a little
bit here will

589
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,240
prevent this like massive
team churn.

590
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,150
It also doesn't come
naturally to

591
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,760
most founders to really
praise their team.

592
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,580
Um, it took me a while to
learn this too.

593
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
You have to let your team
get all the credit for

594
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,380
everything good that
happens, and

595
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,600
you take responsibility for
the bad stuff.

596
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,730
You have to not micromanage.

597
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,160
You have to like continually
give people new areas of

598
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,190
responsibility.

599
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,070
These are not the things
that

600
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,990
most founders think about.

601
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,690
Um, I think the best thing
you can do is be aware that

602
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,750
as a first time founder, you
are likely to be a very bad

603
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,380
manager and try to
overcompensate for that.

604
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,190
Uh, Dan Pink talks about
these three things that

605
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,030
motivate people to do great
work, autonomy, autonomy,

606
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,530
mastery and purpose.

607
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,130
Um, I never thought about
that when I was running my

608
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,110
company, but I've thought
about it since.

609
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,470
And I think that's actually
right, and

610
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,010
I think it's worth trying to
think about that.

611
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,710
Um, it also took me a while
to learn to do

612
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,360
things like one and ones and
give clear feedback.

613
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,860
All of these things that
first time CEOs just don't

614
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,180
do, uh, until they get
burned a few times.

615
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,830
But maybe, maybe I can save
you from doing that.

616
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,670
All right.

617
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,620
And the last part on the
team section uh,

618
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,160
is about firing people when
it's not working.

619
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,470
Um, no matter what I say
here,

620
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,610
this is not gonna prevent
anyone from doing it wrong.

621
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,390
And the reason is that
firing people is one of

622
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,950
the worst parts of running a
company.

623
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,750
Um, actually in my own
experience I

624
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,540
think it is the worst.

625
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,210
Uh, every first time founder
waits too long.

626
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,800
Everyone hopes that an
employee will turn around.

627
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,580
But the right answer is to

628
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,410
fire fast when it's not
working out.

629
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,430
Um, It's better for the
company.

630
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,200
It's also better for the
employee.

631
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,450
But it's so painful and so

632
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,210
awful that everyone gets it
wrong the first few times.

633
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,920
Um, in addition to firing
people who

634
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,230
are doing bad at their job.

635
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,620
You also wanna fire people
who A, create an office

636
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,170
politics, and B, who were
persistently negative.

637
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,090
Um, the rest of the company
is always aware

638
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,830
of employees doing things
like this.

639
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,360
And it's just this huge
drag,

640
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,620
it's completely toxic to the
company.

641
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,930
Ah, again, this is an
example of something that

642
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,470
might work okay in a big
company,

643
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,870
although I'm still
skeptical.

644
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,880
But will kill a startup.

645
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,550
So I think you need to watch
out for

646
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,460
people that are, yes?

647
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,584
>> How do you balance firing
people fast, and

648
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:17,472
making your other employees
feel like

649
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,962
they're secure even if they
screw up sometimes?

650
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:20,748
Cuz you don't want them to

651
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,370
feel like they're out the
door on the first mistake.

652
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:22,990
>> Yeah, sure.

653
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,350
So the question is how do
you fi,

654
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,350
balance firing people fast
and

655
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,570
making the early employees
feel secure?

656
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,480
Um, the answer is the, when
an employee is not working,

657
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,510
it's not like they screw up
once or twice.

658
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,500
Um, anyone will screw up
once or

659
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,280
twice, or more times than
that.

660
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,640
Ah, and, you know, you
should be like very loving,

661
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,790
not take it out on them.

662
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,720
Like, be a teamwork
together.

663
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,500
Ah, if someone is getting
every decision wrong,

664
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,630
that's when you need to act.

665
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,860
And at that point,

666
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,330
it'll, it'll be painfully
aware to everyone.

667
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,330
It's not a case of the few
screw ups.

668
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,360
It's a case where every time
someone does something you

669
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,710
would've done the opposite
yourself.

670
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,580
You don't get to make their
decisions, but

671
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,700
you do get to choose the
decision makers.

672
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,780
And if someone's doing
everything wrong uh,

673
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,640
just like a consistent thing
over like a period of

674
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,100
many weeks or a month.

675
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,130
You'll be aware of it.

676
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,570
This is one of those cases
where in theory it sounds

677
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,650
complicated to be sure what
you're talking about.

678
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,790
And in practice there's
almost never any doubt.

679
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,914
It's the difference between
someone making one or two

680
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:28,000
mistakes and just constantly
screwing everything up, or

681
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,030
causing problems, or making
everyone unhappy is,

682
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,580
is painfully obvious the
first time you see it.

683
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,690
Yes?

684
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,310
>> When should cofounders
decide on the equity split?

685
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,020
>> Great question, when
should cofounders decide on

686
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,450
the equity split?

687
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,700
Uh, for some reason, I've
never really been sure why

688
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,243
this is, a lot of founders,
a lot of cofounders like to

689
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,410
ah, leave this off for a
very long time.

690
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,090
You know, they'll even

691
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,880
sign the incorporation
documents in some crazy way,

692
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,380
so that they can wait to
have this discussion.

693
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,060
This is not a discussion
that gets easier with time.

694
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,760
Um, you want to set this uh,
ideally you

695
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,870
know very soon after you
start working together.

696
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,070
Um, and it should be near
equal.

697
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,490
Um, if you're not willing to
give someone,

698
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,580
your cofounder, you know,

699
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,650
like an equal share of the
equity.

700
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,370
Uh, I think that should make
you think hard

701
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,630
about whether or not you
want them as a cofounder.

702
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,730
Um, but in any case,

703
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,910
you should try to have the
ink dry on this before

704
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,180
the company gets too far
along.

705
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,400
Like certainly in the first
number of weeks.

706
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,236
Yes?
>> Inexperience can be

707
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:30,685
okay uh, but then how do you
know if it's gonna be

708
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,808
crippling and you fire them?

709
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:34,490
That way
>> Um,

710
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,820
so the question is I said
that inexperience is okay.

711
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,731
Um, how do you know if
that's going to,

712
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:42,375
you know, I someone is going
to scale pass, not scale up

713
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,390
to a roll as things go on
and later become crippling.

714
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,190
Um, people that are really
smart, and

715
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,160
they can learn new things
can almost always find

716
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,070
a role in the company as
time goes on.

717
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,690
You may can move them into
something else,

718
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,540
something other than where
they started.

719
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,730
Um, you know, it may be that
you hire someone to

720
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,820
lead the engineering team
that, over time,

721
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,750
can't scale as you get up to
50 people.

722
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,240
And you give him a different
role.

723
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,150
Um, really good people,
though,

724
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,670
can almost always find some
great place in the company.

725
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,615
I have not seen that be a
problem too often.

726
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,586
>> What if your relationship
with your founder or

727
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:13,050
founders breaks down over
time and

728
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,080
you're ready to split equity
and everything?

729
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,963
What's the best way to
>> All

730
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:21,191
right, so the question is,
what happens when your

731
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:24,437
relationship with your
co-founder falls apart.

732
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:26,560
Um, we're gonna have a
session on mechanics.

733
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,720
At, near the end of the
course.

734
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,380
But here's the most
important thing that

735
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,710
founders screw up.

736
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,870
Which is every foun, every
cofounder of,

737
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,650
you yourself, of course, has
to have vesting.

738
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,300
Um, basically what you're
doing with

739
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,875
cofounder vesting is you're

740
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:43,030
pre-negotiating what happens
if one of you leaves.

741
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,980
And so the normal stance on
this in Silicon Valley

742
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,330
is that it takes four years.

743
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,180
Let's say you split the
equity 50 50?

744
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,470
It takes four years to earn
all of that.

745
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,830
Um, and the clock doesn't
start until one year in.

746
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,040
So if you leave after one
year,

747
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,380
you keep 25% of the equity.

748
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,000
If you leave after two
years, 50 and

749
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,260
on and on like that.

750
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,570
Um, if you don't do that and
if you have a huge fallout

751
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,750
and one founder leaves early
on with half the company uh,

752
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,310
you have uh, like this dead
weight uh, of the uh,

753
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,710
on your equity table.

754
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,880
And it's very hard to get
investors to fund you or

755
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,130
to do anything else.

756
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,040
So number one piece of
advice to prevent that
