292
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,900
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFVDjrvQJdw
and there's a lot of
competition.

293
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,970
At the same time, in the
consumer space,

294
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,440
you are always fighting this
issue of,

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,410
how do you monetize?

296
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,160
How do you, how

297
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,760
do you actually get people
to pay for products?

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,570
And in the consumer space,
there's really only two sort

299
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,960
of business models that you
can do.

300
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,250
You can have people pay for
your application.

301
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,410
Or you can provide
advertising on

302
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,150
the application.

303
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,820
And so just to give you a
little bit of perspective,

304
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,000
these are today's numbers.

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,936
Just to give you a little
bit of a sense of

306
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,285
the scale difference, in the
consumer world,

307
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,225
there's about $35 billion
spent on

308
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,902
mobile apps every year,
pretty big number, right?

309
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:25,030
$35 billion that's,

310
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,840
that's a lot of money being
spent on mobile apps today.

311
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,750
For advertising, the global
digital advertising market

312
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,140
is $135 billion.

313
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,230
So, you know, basically
combined

314
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,930
most consumer companies are
going after, if you're not

315
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,180
doing e-commerce, about $170
billion of

316
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,580
either sort of purchasing
power on applications or

317
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,340
global advertising around
these kinds of services.

318
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,165
So, big numbers, lot of
opportunity there, however,

319
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:57,232
in enterprise, there's
actually $3.7 trillion spent

320
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:00,130
on enterprise IT every
single year.

321
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,880
So these are the servers,
the infrastructure,

322
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,250
the software, the
networking, the services.

323
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,930
All of that stack of
technology equates to

324
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,160
a few trillion dollars spent
every single year.

325
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,510
And so what we realized was,
okay,

326
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,130
there's a pretty wide delta
between these two markets.

327
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,640
We are gonna be fighting
over trying to

328
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,360
get consumers to pay a few
dollars a month.

329
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,350
And Google and Microsoft and
Apple will probably try and

330
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,980
make this product be free
over time.

331
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,310
And there were sort of
rumors that Google Drive was

332
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,710
coming out and these kind of
products that

333
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,540
eventually happened were
going to come out.

334
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,160
But in the enterprise, it's
not so much about that they

335
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,820
are trying to always save
money on IT.

336
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,090
They're actually trying to
increase productivity.

337
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,820
They're trying to

338
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
get higher performance from
their businesses.

339
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,605
So the value equation is
very different right?

340
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,650
In consumer, we have a
limited amount of money that

341
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,030
we want to actually make
sure that we conserve for

342
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,210
as few things as possible
that we're gonna spend.

343
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,190
In the enterprise,

344
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,410
it's a little bit of a
different shift,

345
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,950
where you're trying to think
about actually,

346
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,750
what can I get out of
technology, and

347
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,890
how much value is that for
me.

348
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,070
So, that was a really
important data point.

349
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,860
However, the problem was
that enterprise software

350
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,170
was really, really unsexy.

351
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,360
Right?
So again, very competitive,

352
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,750
very difficult to build a
business.

353
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,530
It wasn't something that
really you should have

354
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,190
shot out of bed in the
morning and said, okay, I'm

355
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,810
super excited to build an
enterprise software company.

356
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,510
And the reason for

357
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,600
that was actually pretty
straightforward at the time.

358
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,665
The way that you built
software was very slow.

359
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,710
So you had to be very slow
because

360
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,730
you couldn't break anything
for customers.

361
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,878
The sales process was very
slow because customers take

362
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:35,008
a long time to purchase
technology.

363
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,364
So I think everyone's sort
of used to this concept that

364
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:39,617
usually when you try and
sell enterprise software to

365
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,662
a company, it can take up to
a couple of years for

366
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,424
them to actually just buy
the software.

367
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,883
And then they can take a
couple more years for

368
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:48,145
them to even implement the
technology in

369
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:51,070
the first place, so a lot of
companies are around for

370
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,064
a few years without having
their technology even used

371
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:55,216
in the enterprise.

372
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:57,087
That felt like a huge
problem.

373
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,527
And not like something we
wanted to be a part of.

374
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:02,268
The technology itself is
fairly complex.

375
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,514
So the user experience, I
don't know how many

376
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:07,107
people have had to use most
enterprise software, but

377
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,920
it's generally really
complicated.

378
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,010
You find yourself asking why
in God's name did

379
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,000
the designer try to put 47
buttons on the page.

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,294
And you just can't even
understand it, and

381
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,027
the reason is something
we'll get into in a second.

382
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:25,195
But basically, there's just
no love or

383
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:27,427
care for the design and user
experience,

384
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,870
the software's just really
complex.

385
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,108
And then, finally, if that
wasn't bad enough,

386
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,500
all of a sudden you had to

387
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,590
think about how do actually
sell the software.

388
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,200
And, for anybody who loves
the power of the internet.

389
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,460
This notion of having a
sorta sales intermediary, to

390
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,460
get to your customer, seemed
like, really unappealing.

391
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,779
Like, you're gonna have to
go hire a bunch of people

392
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,110
that, that are gonna be
everywhere in the country.

393
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,500
And they're gonna be the
only interface,

394
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,620
you have to your customer.

395
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,259
You're gonna have to hire
these guys named Chuck.

396
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,700
And Chuck's gonna roll in
with a briefcase, and

397
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
he's gonna just try and

398
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,620
sell, lots of enterprise
software to the customer.

399
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,450
Just so we're clear, this is
what Chuck looks like.

400
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:09,480
And that was the sales
process that you, in

401
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,585
the enterprise, that we at
least imagined in our heads.

402
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:15,760
And I mean, Chuck looks like
a happy guy, but

403
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,970
he's still an intermediary
to getting your software.

404
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,150
And we were saying, well,

405
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,120
why can't we take the power
of the Internet and

406
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,760
actually, get our technology
out to people directly?

407
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,822
Why should we have to go
through this

408
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,515
sales intermediary as we
scale the business?

409
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:32,677
Now, I'll get into, in, in a
minute,

410
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:35,159
why we were wrong about, the
sales process but

411
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,150
this was the sort of fear
that we had at the time.

412
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,233
And then, if that wasn't
hard enough we

413
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,626
had investors in 2007 saying
basically,

414
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,560
there's no way you're gonna
make it in the enterprise.

415
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,250
You basically are again,

416
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,290
a founding team of, of early
20 year olds.

417
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,950
You don't have anybody on
your team that has been in

418
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,260
the enterprise.

419
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,330
The Microsoft and Google and
all these things are, or

420
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,310
not Google, but Microsoft,
EMC, Oracle, IBM.

421
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,190
These kinds of companies are
gonna stomp on you and

422
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,880
it's gonna be very, very
hard to actually achieve.

423
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,460
And to be fair they were

424
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,940
right on a number of areas,
right?

425
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,952
So we were a very
inexperienced team.

426
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,770
This is this was a,

427
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,160
in a stage where it is still
early in our careers.

428
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,018
My co-founder, for

429
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,910
instance, looked like he was
13 years old.

430
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,656
So just not really, just to
be clear.

431
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:19,610
This is what he looked like.

432
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,792
So So it, it sorta made
sense.

433
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,670
Right?

434
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,531
This is, this is him as our
CFO at,

435
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:27,036
I think this is him at 29.

436
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:30,820
But it looked like we were
gonna go run

437
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,680
off with the money and go to
Disneyland.

438
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,050
So I can totally appreciate
why they didn't think we

439
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,080
would be able to pull it
off.

440
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,750
I can't imagine giving him
money.

441
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,750
So basically, we decided
okay well we still have to

442
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,080
go do it, we have to just
give it our best shot.

443
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,933
We're gonna take the sorta
scale,

444
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,603
the consumer experience, the
DNA of our company.

445
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,313
We're gonna see if we can
bring this,

446
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:57,131
into the enterprise and then
we were very

447
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:59,429
fortunate where actually we
had an investor who was

448
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,580
equally early in his career
and made a bet on us.

449
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,240
Because sorta with the
belief that there was

450
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,550
something fundamentally
changing about the

451
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,890
enterprise that we would be
able to take advantage of.

452
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,757
And so, we decided that if
we're gonna do the

453
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,350
enterprise, if we're gonna
go after the enterprise.

454
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,140
That we would have to

455
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,955
play by a very different set
of rules.

456
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:19,230
So, what about the
complexity of

457
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,430
software can change in this
new era?

458
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,600
What about the fact that the
sales process is very slow,

459
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,590
can change in this new area,
era?

460
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,650
How do we move and go
directly to the user and

461
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,350
to the customer.

462
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,500
As opposed to having this
very, sorta indirect process

463
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,030
of getting our technology
out there?

464
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,270
How do we build, in design
for that user as opposed to,

465
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,700
just for the sale and sorta
for the RFP process that

466
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,820
a customer is going to go
through.

467
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,010
And so we looked at all of
the factors,

468
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,080
that were true of the
enterprise.

469
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,770
And we said, we're gonna do,
maybe not in all cases,

470
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,620
the opposite, but we're
gonna find what is changed

471
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,010
about the technology world.

472
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,280
Where we can take advantage
of that shift and build a,

473
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,300
a better and a newer
enterprise software company.

474
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,120
And so,

475
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,880
that was the decision that
we embarked on.

476
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,970
This is the path that we
embarked on

477
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,240
about eight years ago.

478
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,990
And that is why, we've been
focusing on the enterprise.

479
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,970
And so today, again, we have
about 240,000 businesses

480
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,940
that use the product.

481
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,140
And the reason is, we
architected the business

482
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,730
model, we architected the
software.

483
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,475
We architected the solution,
to

484
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:23,920
work in sorta one specific
version of the world.

485
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,970
And it turned out that that
version ended up being,

486
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,320
the sort of, the one that
happened.

487
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,020
And I'll go into a little
bit

488
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,597
about what has changed about
the world.

489
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,472
That we sorta built out
company around.

490
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,260
And what, I would highly
recommend you,

491
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,400
if your building an
enterprise software company,

492
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,190
make sure to orient to your
technology and

493
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,850
solution around.

494
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,090
So, that was, sort of, why
we made the decision,

495
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,260
and kind of how we started
to take on the problem.

496
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,130
Now I'd talk, like to talk a
little bit about.

497
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,140
What has changed about the
enterprise,

498
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,830
that makes it sort of so
possible to enter it today,

499
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,370
better and more seamlessly
than ever before.

500
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,410
So, everything about the
enterprise and then

501
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,180
by definition the software
that an enterprise uses,

502
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,420
has changed just in the past
five years.

503
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,790
This is probably the most
magical time.

504
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,230
If there could have ever
been a magical time to

505
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,060
build an enterprise software
company now is

506
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,920
absolutely that time.

507
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,430
Just in terms of how much
change is going on

508
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,630
within organizations.

509
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,160
So let's just go through a
couple of these things.

510
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,520
So, the first is that most
application categories

511
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,660
are moving to the cloud.

512
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,670
And the big difference is
this idea that if you were

513
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,410
going to start a customer
relationship management

514
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,800
software company, or

515
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,780
a business intelligence
software company.

516
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,120
Or even a content management
company ten, 15 years

517
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,020
ago, you basically had to go
have your technology be

518
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,400
implemented, in every single
customer location.

519
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
No matter how many customers
you sold to,

520
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,790
no matter what regions
they're in, every single

521
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,600
customer had to put that in
their data center.

522
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,440
And that was the flaw with
on-premise computing,

523
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,510
was you were repeating all
of this work.

524
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,540
You were, creating so much
redundancy.

525
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,480
And it was, it was

526
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,740
then slowing down the entire
process of delivering and

527
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,560
building software for the
enterprise.

528
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,850
And then all of the sudden
the cloud came around.

529
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,830
Things like Salesforce.com,
things like

530
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,500
Amazon Web Services that
basically said.

531
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,920
Why is it that, that every
customer,

532
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,230
that wants to just implement
a couple servers,

533
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,450
has to go procure the
servers.

534
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,000
Put them in their data
center put all the security,

535
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,770
all the networking around
those servers.

536
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,270
And then, and

537
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,060
then, six months later they
go live and

538
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,490
then a developer can use
them in the organization, or

539
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,220
same thing with an
application.

540
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,110
Amazon said why does that
make any sense today?

541
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,970
When we could just, put
together thousands,

542
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,200
tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands of servers and

543
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,640
make them available on
demand.

544
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,520
And you just use what you
want when you need that.

545
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
And that was, that's
obviously a definition of

546
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,330
cloud computing.

547
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,660
What is happening, though,
is finally CIOs in large

548
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,670
enterprises are taking
advantage of this.

549
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,750
So it's, it seems obvious
for

550
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,130
everyone in this room
because you would

551
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,020
never build, a company by
buying your own servers.

552
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,850
You would start it on
Amazon, or, or

553
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,720
Google or Azure or whatever.

554
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,990
But to an enterprise,

555
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,540
there are decades, literally
decades of investment in

556
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,950
infrastructure, that now has
to move to the cloud.

557
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,610
And so that's obviously a
massive shift that is

558
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,060
finally happening.

559
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,120
We are moving to a world of
cheaper, low cost, on demand

560
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,730
computing, from a world of
expensive computing.

561
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,320
The benefit to building a
start up,

562
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,800
is that customers don't have
the same kinda friction.

563
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,250
When they're gonna go adopt
new technology, right?

564
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,910
As soon as the computing, is
so much cheaper,

565
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,050
it becomes easier to adopt
new solutions.

566
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,130
Which means, that their
barrier for

567
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,350
having a conversation.

568
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,190
Their barrier for
introducing you then,

569
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,710
into their enterprise, is a
lot lower,

570
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,840
which creates a massive
opportunity for start-ups.

571
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
We're going from a world of
customized software,

572
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,860
to really standardized
platforms.

573
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,720
So it used to be that you
had to

574
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,940
build custom integration's
and all of

575
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,580
the custom experiences on
top of the software itself.

576
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,860
And now, customers are
realizing that actually they

577
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,530
want, open platforms and
they can customize at

578
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,380
the layer above the, the
product.

579
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,000
It used to be that when you
were building enterprise

580
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,145
software company you could
only really sell to,

581
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:05,230
the top five or 10,000
companies in the world.

582
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,890
Because only those
companies,
