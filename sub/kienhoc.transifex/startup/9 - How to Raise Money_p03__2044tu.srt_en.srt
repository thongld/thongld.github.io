535
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,910
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFX95HahaUs
of lay the foundation for
future fundraising events.

536
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,260
You know, they're gonna make
the right introductions.

537
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,820
And I think there's a,

538
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,370
an enormous difference in
the quality of,

539
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,230
of an introduction.

540
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,650
So if you can get a really
good introduction from

541
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,900
someone who a venture
capitalist really trusts and

542
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,500
respects, you know, the
likelihood that, that's

543
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,820
gonna go well is so much
higher than sort of like a,

544
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,650
you know, a much, kind of a
much, a much more lukewarm

545
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,060
introduction from someone
they don't know as well.

546
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,770
So the seed stage, probably
the best thing you can

547
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,610
do is find the right
investors.

548
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,161
And then
>> How,

549
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,469
how does the founder know
who the right investors are?

550
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,850
Well I think it's really
hard.

551
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,430
I mean so one of the best
ways, I mean, you know,

552
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,970
not to give a plug for YC
but you know,

553
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,080
YC does a really good job
telling you exactly who they

554
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,090
think those people are.

555
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,110
And and can really direct
you towards a,

556
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,720
and I've actually have found
it

557
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,400
to be like pretty accurate
in terms of like who you

558
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,310
guys said were going to be
the best people like.

559
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,080
They ended up being the most
helpful as we were

560
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,710
raising subsequent rounds.

561
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,570
Sort of, you know,

562
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,000
really providing the best
introductions.

563
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,950
And the people who maybe I
thought were, you know,

564
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,410
seemed okay, but were not,
you know, like,

565
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,470
we're not as, sort of,
highly rated by YC.

566
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,500
Like, they, that ended up
being the case that they

567
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,690
were, kind of, like, real
duds, in the seed round.

568
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,630
>> Someday we're gonna
publish our

569
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,790
list of these people.

570
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,200
>> Oh my god there are going
to

571
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,410
be a lot of upset people
when you do.

572
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,840
>> So, how, how do you think
about negotiation?

573
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,096
How do you figure out what
the right evaluation for

574
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,740
a company is and what are
the terms?

575
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,600
>> Well so I started out.

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,590
I mean like when I was
raising my seed around I

577
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,410
really didn't know.

578
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,160
And, and I mean we had
conversations about this.

579
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,490
I probably started a little
too high on

580
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,360
the valuation side.

581
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,350
And the, so as you guys
know, like Y company sort of

582
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,120
culminates in this thing
called demo day,

583
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
where you can get sort of
all of these investors at

584
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,590
once, who are looking at the
company.

585
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,217
And I started out trying to
raise money at like a $12 or

586
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:21,170
a $15 million dollar.

587
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,480
Which is like not quite the
same thing as a valuation,

588
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,210
but sort of rough, rough,
roughly equivalent.

589
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,330
And everyone was like,
that's crazy.

590
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,290
You know, that's, that's
completely nuts.

591
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,920
They're, like, you're, like,
too big for

592
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,620
your britches, like,

593
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,950
that, that's completely,
just wouldn't work.

594
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,670
And so I ended up sort of
walking it down a little bit

595
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,440
and, and within, sort of the
space of a couple

596
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,110
days said okay, well I'm
gonna raise at nine.

597
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,140
And then suddenly, for
whatever reason that had

598
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,920
sort of hit some magical
threshold on the seed,

599
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,590
seed stage, that it was
below 10.

600
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,690
It seemed like there was
like,

601
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,900
almost infinite demand, for
the round at a,

602
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,160
at a like, at a 9 million
cap.

603
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,885
So no-one would pay 12 but
at a $9 million cap it felt

604
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:58,703
like I probably could have
raised like,

605
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:00,190
ten million dollars.

606
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,030
And the, the round came
together you know,

607
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,500
in, in, in roughly about a
week.

608
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,300
At that point once I kind a
hit that threshold.

609
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,070
And so there seemed to be,

610
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,690
and they probably fluctuate
over time, but

611
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,960
there seem to be these sort
of, like, thresholds,

612
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,740
particularly for seed-stage
companies, that, that,

613
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,170
that investors will think of
as, like, this is what,

614
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,100
you know, like, above this
level is like, crazy.

615
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,700
That, like, doesn't matter.

616
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,410
And there's sort of like a
rough kinda range that

617
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,410
that people are willing to
pay.

618
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,690
And so, you just kinda like,
you, you,

619
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,010
you just have to kinda
figure out what that is.

620
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,210
Get the money that you need.

621
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,940
Don't, don't raise any more
than you need and,

622
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,600
and, and just kinda get it
done.

623
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,390
And you know, at the end of
the day like, whether,

624
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,470
whether you raise a 12 or
nine or like six, it's not,

625
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,090
it's not a huge deal for the
rest of the company.

626
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,039
>> Is there a maximum amount
of the company you think

627
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,555
the founders should sell in
their seed round era?

628
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:53,860
Beyond which, problems for
any of you.

629
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,600
>> I feel like that's a
better question for you.

630
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,460
>> Well, gosh, I don't know.

631
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,890
I mean, you know?

632
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,900
I think, On, on, I mean, I
don't,

633
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,460
I don't know the rules on
this stuff.

634
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,120
I think the, the tricky
thing, is, is, I mean,

635
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,110
it seems like they were kind
of rough.

636
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,330
Particularly for, like, a
series A you're probably

637
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,980
gonna sell somewhere
between, you know, 20 and

638
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,280
30% of the company because
you know,

639
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,188
below, venture capitalists
tend to be a lot more

640
00:24:21,188 --> 00:24:23,620
ownership-focused than
price-focused.

641
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,430
So you might find that it's
actually,

642
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,170
sometimes when companies
raise really big rounds.

643
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,502
It's because, you know, the
investor basically said

644
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,636
listen I'm not gonna go
below 20% ownership but

645
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:33,920
I'll pay more for it.

646
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,200
And so, and, and above 30%
probably sort of

647
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,650
weird things happen to the
cap table.

648
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,060
Like it gets hard, you know,
down the line to sort of,

649
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,130
you know, for

650
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,730
there to be enough room on
the cap table for everyone.

651
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,890
And so everything seems to
come in at that range.

652
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,480
So that probably just is
what it is, in most cases.

653
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,930
So, at, you know, at the
seed stage.

654
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,640
I mean, what I've heard.

655
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,410
There doesn't seem to me any
magic to it.

656
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,010
But it seems like ten to
15%,

657
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,590
is what, what people say.

658
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,630
But what, that's mostly just
what I've heard.

659
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,180
I'm curious at your guy's
thoughts.

660
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,220
>> Yeah, I, I agree with all
that.

661
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,090
I think it's important to
get the process over with.

662
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,000
But I think it's important
for the founder to say to

663
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,910
themselves in the beginning,
at, at what point does

664
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,770
my ownership start to
de-motivate me?

665
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,190
Because it there's like a
40% dilution

666
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,950
in an angel round.

667
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,060
I've actually said to the
founder,

668
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,600
do you realize you've
already doomed yourself.

669
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,270
You know, you, you're gonna
own less than 5%

670
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,540
of this company if you're a
normal company.

671
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,476
And so, these guidelines are
important.

672
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:50,770
The, the, you know, the, the
10 to 15%,

673
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,570
because if you keep giving
away more than that,

674
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,300
there's not enough left for
you and

675
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,570
the team, and you're the
ones doing all the work.

676
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,760
>> Thank you.

677
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,280
>> Well actually, we'll
walk, we've, we've seen a,

678
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,780
we've seen a series of
interesting companies in

679
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,470
the last five years that,
where they just, you,

680
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,540
we just walk, oh, simply, we
won't, we won't bid.

681
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,170
Sometimes the basis of

682
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,920
the cap table's already
destroyed.

683
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,750
Outside investors already
own too much.

684
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,170
There's a company we really
wanted to invest in but

685
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,960
the outside investors
already owned 80% of

686
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,270
it when we, when we talked
to them.

687
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,570
And it was still a
relatively young company.

688
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,510
They had just done two early
rounds that had

689
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,350
just sold too much of the
company.

690
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,130
And literally we were
worried, and

691
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,960
I think accurately so,

692
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,140
that it was gonna be
demotivating for

693
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,720
that team to have that
structure.

694
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,444
>> One more question for

695
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,300
you before we open up to the
audience.

696
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,020
for, for Ron and Clark.

697
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,740
Could you guys both tell the
story of the most successful

698
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,130
investment you ever made and
how that came to happen?

699
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,860
>> Other than Zenefits of
course.

700
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,310
>> Yeah, other than
Zenefits.

701
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,700
>> Yeah other than Zenefits.

702
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,070
That's gonna be hard.

703
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,230
For me clearly it

704
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,490
was the investment in Google
in 1999.

705
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:58,270
>> And we got we got Google
return out of it.

706
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,830
But funny enough I met

707
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,770
Google through a Standford
professor David Cheriton.

708
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,830
Who was in the school of
engineering.

709
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,580
He's still here.

710
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,990
He was actually an angel
investor in Google.

711
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,730
And an investor in our fund,
and

712
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,950
kind of the quid pro quo we
have with our investors in

713
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,640
the fund is you have to tell
us

714
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,010
about any interesting
companies that you see.

715
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,390
And we loved it the day that
Jared was an investor in

716
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,170
our fund because he had
access to

717
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,980
the computer science
department's deal flow.

718
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,220
And we were at this party at
the of DFA's house in

719
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,490
full tuxedo.

720
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,230
I hate tuxedos.

721
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,760
And day, have you, anyone
here know David Sheraton?

722
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,260
Cuz you know for sure he
does not like tuxedos, and

723
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,430
he was in a tuxedo.

724
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,210
But I went up to him and

725
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,030
we complained about our
attire and then I said, hey,

726
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,680
what's happening in, at
Stanford?

727
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,470
And he says, well there's
this project called Backrub.

728
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,140
And it's search, and

729
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,790
it's search by page rank and
relevancy.

730
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,720
And back in, today page rank
and relevancy,

731
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,510
everyone says, oh, you know,
that's so obvious.

732
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,860
In 1998, that was not
obvious that engineers were

733
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:15,370
designing a product based on
this thing called page rank.

734
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,630
And all it was was a simple
algorithm that said,

735
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,590
if a lot of people go to
that website and

736
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,610
other websites direct them
there,

737
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,970
there must be something good
happening on that website.

738
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,520
That was the original
algorithm.

739
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,340
And the, the motivation was
relevance.

740
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,770
So I said to David, I have
to meet these people.

741
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,630
And he said, you can't meet
them till they're ready.

742
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,069
Which was the following May
funny enough.

743
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:42,149
>> I waited.
I called them

744
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:44,280
every month for five months.

745
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,270
And finally got my audition
with Larry and Sergei.

746
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,860
And right away they were
very strategic.

747
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,490
They said, we'll let you
invest if you can

748
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,660
get sequoia.

749
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,340
We don't know sequoia but
they're investors in Yahoo!

750
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,820
and because we're late to
market we want to

751
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,560
know we have a deal with
Yahoo!

752
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
And, and so

753
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,749
I earned my way into the
investment in Google.

754
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,860
How about you?
>> So,

755
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,540
I was talking about on the
other side which is,

756
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
which is Airbnb.

757
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,950
Which we actually were not
early investors in.

758
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,120
We were, we did an, Airbnb
as growth round.

759
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,470
We did the first big growth
round at Airbnb.

760
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,450
yeah.
At about a billion dollar

761
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,250
valuation in to 2011.

762
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,530
And I think that will turn
out to be,

763
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,493
I believe that will turn out
to be one of the spectacular

764
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:29,174
growth investments of all
time, we'll see.

765
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:32,389
But I think it's gonna be
one of the big companies.

766
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,099
So I tell that story because
it's,

767
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,170
it's not a story of pure
genius.

768
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,870
It's a we, we passed, we
didn't even met with them,

769
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,180
I don't think we met with
them the first time around,

770
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,910
or maybe one of our junior
people did.

771
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,170
But it was one of these,
it's you know,

772
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,850
I said earlier that venture
capital is

773
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,440
entirely a game of outliers,
right?

774
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,025
One of the key things with
outliers is

775
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:50,081
the ideas often seem
completely nuts up front.

776
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,332
And so, of course, the idea
of a website where you can

777
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,582
have other people stay in
your house, if you just like

778
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:56,682
made a list of the ideas
that are like, most nuts,

779
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:58,557
that would be like, right
there at the top.

780
00:29:58,557 --> 00:29:59,418
And then.

781
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:01,697
>> I have a very nice e-mail
from you

782
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:02,470
>> Good, good.

783
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,769
I was hoping I was very
courteous in my stupidity.

784
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,154
Well the second most stupid
idea you

785
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:08,170
could possibly think of is

786
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,350
a website where you can stay
in other people's houses.

787
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,720
And so that the

788
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,529
>> Uniquely combines both of
those bad ideas.

789
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,690
>> So, of course, it turns
out they've unlocked

790
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,166
an entirely new way to
basically, sell real estate.

791
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,930
They've unlocked this just
gigantic number of

792
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,960
gigantic global phenomenon.

793
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,300
It's gonna be an enormously
successful company.

794
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,290
So part was just coming to
grips with the fact that we

795
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,710
had whiffed on our initial
analysis of the idea.

796
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,460
And that the numbers were

797
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,080
clearly proving that we were
wrong.

798
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,720
And the customer behavior
was clearly

799
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,880
proving that we were wrong.

800
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,748
So one of our philosophies
at our firm is

801
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,000
that we're multistage.
