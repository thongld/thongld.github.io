981
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,430
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAws7eXItMk
Yes.

982
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,001
>> Since you mentioned
recording did you try to

983
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:36,557
insist on

984
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:39,620
doing Skype interviews rather
than over email or?

985
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,710
>> What was your impression
of?

986
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,260
>> Yeah.
So you definitely want to do

987
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,300
Skype or sorry the question
was,

988
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,110
do we insist on Skype
interviews for recording.

989
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,230
You don't want to

990
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,330
do interviews over email if
you can avoid it

991
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,420
because interviews over email
are non interactive.

992
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,710
And the most interesting
things you learn in

993
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,240
interviews come from the
interesting, tell me more.

994
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,740
because the instant that you
hit, you hope this vein of

995
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,110
they'll say something you
didn't expect, and

996
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,780
the instant they say something
you didn't expect or didn't

997
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,270
already know, you should drop
into detective mode, and

998
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,730
detective mode is huh, that's
interesting.

999
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,230
Can you tell me more about
that?

1000
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,310
And people don't like silence,
so

1001
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,300
they'll keep talking to fill
the void.

1002
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,020
And the best part about doing
it over Skype or

1003
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,940
doing it in person is you have
that interactive feedback.

1004
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,245
And you can actually pull a
lot more out of people.

1005
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:26,920
E-mail interviews are, they're
okay.

1006
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,750
But they're basically useless.

1007
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,370
If you're in person or

1008
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,090
over Skype, they're actually
also easy to record.

1009
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,150
Make sure you ask them if it's
okay to record it.

1010
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,240
It's not polite to record
people without their consent.

1011
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,710
But if they're willing to like
give you like an in,

1012
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,800
a user interview, they're
probably willing for

1013
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,560
you to record it as well.

1014
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,280
>> Sorry, but what about the
international market?

1015
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,852
Like you mentioned if that you
had a lot of

1016
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,342
interviews in Korea, and

1017
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:50,613
I don't know maybe feel
comfortable with English, or.

1018
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:52,991
>> Yeah, so the question is
like what about people in

1019
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:55,088
the international market where
you're trying to do

1020
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:57,630
youth interviews with people
who don't speak your language.

1021
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,510
That's just really hard.

1022
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,280
And actually to this day
Twitch works way better in

1023
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,690
English speaking countries
than it

1024
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,970
does in non English speaking
countries.

1025
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,880
And I think a big part of that
is, we are much better at

1026
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,510
talking to people in English
speaking countries, and

1027
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,480
learning what their needs are.

1028
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,360
And we're not as good at it,
in other countries.

1029
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,210
We've tried to address that by

1030
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,120
hiring people who speak
Korean.

1031
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,950
Having them translate.

1032
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,650
We've tried to address that
by, finding representative

1033
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,920
people in those countries who
speak both English and

1034
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,370
Korean, and reaching out to
them.

1035
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,350
But the problem with that, is,
like the, you're

1036
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,890
not actually getting a
representative sample.

1037
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,220
No matter how hard you try.

1038
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,730
The very fact that they are a
fluent English

1039
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,220
speaker means they're not
representative of

1040
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,400
all the people who don't speak
fluent English.

1041
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,690
It's just a hard problem.

1042
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,510
It's why companies find it
easier to wi,

1043
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,720
build markets that went in
their home,

1044
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,950
in their home country.

1045
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,050
Much more easily than abroad.

1046
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,760
Because it's really hard to
talk to users abroad.

1047
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,450
Yes.

1048
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,069
>> What channels did you use
to reach out to them, and

1049
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:53,390
do you ever compensate them?

1050
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,520
>> So the channels we used to,

1051
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,850
what channels did we use to
reach out to them and

1052
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,140
what did we ever compensate
them?

1053
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,460
The channels we used to reach
out to them,

1054
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,820
were, on site messaging
systems.

1055
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,330
So like, if you're, most site
websites have some way to

1056
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,030
contact the user, so if
they're a visible user of

1057
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,640
another website you use that
sites messaging system and

1058
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,150
say hey, I was watching your
stream, or

1059
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,290
whatever this person was doing
on the site.

1060
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:17,740
I'd love to ask you some
questions about your use

1061
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,780
would you mind hopping on a
Skype call?

1062
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,710
And as for, the other thing we
do is we find out who people

1063
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,029
were and we send them emails.

1064
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,760
we'd, like, rented some at
events.

1065
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,370
because a lot of these people
go to the same events and we,

1066
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,400
like, would go to the events
and,

1067
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,520
like, get, we wouldn't run the
user interview at the event,

1068
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,930
but you get to know them, you
exchange business cards or,

1069
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,070
you know, whatever it is you
actually do now aren't,

1070
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,290
isn't business cards.

1071
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,560
And, and you, you get in touch
with them.

1072
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,950
We tended not to compensate
people.

1073
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,310
I think that if you, if no,

1074
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,910
if people don't care enough
about the problem to,

1075
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,640
like, talk to someone who's
trying to solve it.

1076
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,920
You're probably barking up the
wrong tree.

1077
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,240
We never had any trouble
getting people to

1078
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,400
talk to us about paying them.

1079
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,340
>> What about on site user
feedback tools?

1080
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,864
Do you get a little feedback
from that?

1081
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:03,373
>> So, so there's this whole
second set of user feedback

1082
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,100
that's really important, that
I should talk about,.

1083
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,610
The question was,

1084
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,020
what about, like, on site user
feedback tools?

1085
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,690
And I think this stuff you're
talking about is

1086
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,420
where you have like a, a new
product and

1087
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,710
you want to see how, if it's
actually going to work or not.

1088
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,840
And so you put it in front of
people and

1089
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,270
you see how they use it or
not.

1090
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,410
That's really important.

1091
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,130
That kind of work is super
important and

1092
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,020
it can tell you lots of things
about where you went wrong

1093
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,250
building something before you
launch it, which is great.

1094
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,960
It doesn't tell you what to
build.

1095
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,010
It it helps you iron out the
kinks and

1096
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,810
edges of the thing you did
build.

1097
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:38,520
But generally speaking we that
wasn't kind of the user

1098
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,180
feedback we were getting I
mean that's stuffs good

1099
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,000
it's good it's like it's much
more similar to the,

1100
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,480
to the data driven approach.

1101
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,545
Right?
You're finding out,

1102
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,829
why are people dropping off in
this flow, you're not

1103
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:50,216
finding out what problems
should I really be solving for

1104
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,477
them, and what, what do they
care about as a human.

1105
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,010
And, for

1106
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,007
this kind of like really early
stages interview which

1107
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:59,484
the kind of user interview
that's crucial startups do,.

1108
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,536
>> That's the, that's where
you want to focus, so

1109
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,038
we didn't bring on site
actually it

1110
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:04,401
almost all over phone or
Skype.

1111
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,991
Yes.

1112
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,592
>> So for the three different
groups of people there are

1113
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:12,547
different kinds of feedback so
as a startup time and

1114
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:15,045
resources, is that a good area
to focus on first?

1115
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:15,632
>> Yeah.
So

1116
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:18,375
with the three different kinds
of people did we focused on

1117
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,830
one of them given that we had
very limited resources, yes.

1118
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,680
We focused on the competing
people using

1119
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,510
competing products.

1120
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,180
Because, we knew that they
already were interested in

1121
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,220
the behavior that we needed
and

1122
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,685
they were willing to do it at
all.

1123
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:36,210
And therefore all we had to do
is convince them to switch,

1124
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,880
which is a much easier thing
to do than to try to

1125
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,840
create new behavior where none
existed before.

1126
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,600
And we had to do that because
we had to get some quick wins,

1127
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,545
because my gaming project
inside of

1128
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:46,990
Justin.tv would have been
killed if it wasn't

1129
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,570
showing 25% month over month
growth every single month.

1130
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,450
So we did, and that meant
focusing on

1131
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,990
short term get the people in
right now.

1132
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,800
And that turned out to be good
in general because it turns

1133
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,400
out that building something
that some people want

1134
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,230
generally generalizes and so I
want to bring in

1135
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,780
people who weren't even users
of the service as well.

1136
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,040
Yes.

1137
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,622
>> Twitch has been around from
the beginning so

1138
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,510
it filled up, for example the
video game industry.

1139
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,141
In the beginning this industry
was very like, decentralized,

1140
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,526
like there wasn't a lot of
cohesion with like, you know,

1141
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:18,403
different video game

1142
00:43:18,403 --> 00:43:21,110
companies consolidating where
tournaments are and stuff.

1143
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,290
But now it's very different.

1144
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,980
So you said originally you
spoke to like broadcasters and

1145
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,170
you know streamers themselves,
how does that change when

1146
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:32,950
like, for example like Riot
has you know, banned users or

1147
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,088
professional players from
streaming their own stuff.

1148
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:37,240
Have you tried to you know,
gain leverage with that or?

1149
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,600
>> Yeah, so the question is

1150
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,290
what about the game publishers
basically, right?

1151
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,280
The game publishers is huge

1152
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,520
important people in this
space.

1153
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,890
a, the game publisher is and
any big company for

1154
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,670
that matter isn't going to
give you the time of day as

1155
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,060
a small start up.

1156
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,980
Which is both good and bad.

1157
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,005
It means you don't really
need,

1158
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,428
need to talk to them because,

1159
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:56,380
they're they're not interested
in you.

1160
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,370
But it means you actually just
can't talk to them,

1161
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,840
I mean we tried but no one
wanted to talk to us.

1162
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,350
And they did once we started
getting some traction and, and

1163
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,140
becoming a little bit,

1164
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,348
slightly bit of a player in
the space.

1165
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:08,645
I don't want to like, talk
that bad about of them

1166
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:11,560
because they, they, they were
nice about it enough about it

1167
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,790
it's just that you know, when
you're, when you're

1168
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,990
a tiny little start up there's
lots of tiny start ups and

1169
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,470
they, they don't have the time
to talk to all of you.

1170
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,380
As we've gotten bigger
actually the point that,

1171
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,630
you know, game publishers have

1172
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,290
become an increasingly
important constituency for us.

1173
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,310
And if I was to talk about who
Twitch does user interviews

1174
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,530
with now, who we who we pulled
information from now it would

1175
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,920
include game publishers
definitely because they'd be,

1176
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,570
they've become much more
active in the space.

1177
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,600
It was something that they
weren't particularly active

1178
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,640
three or four years ago as
much as they are now.

1179
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,017
And that's another really
important point about user

1180
00:44:42,017 --> 00:44:42,950
interviews in general.

1181
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,533
Which is that the pool of
people you care about is

1182
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:45,410
going to shift over time.

1183
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,620
The people who get you
started,

1184
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,540
like the crucial people to get
your product started for

1185
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,940
the first six months,

1186
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,720
are not who will be using it
three years later.

1187
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,460
And it's very important you
keep, doing this stuff.

1188
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,700
Because one thing that's
really easy to do,

1189
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,450
is to do a little bit of it in
the beginning.

1190
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,105
And, and achieve some level of
success, and then you sort of,

1191
00:45:02,105 --> 00:45:03,540
stop talking to new people.

1192
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,560
And that's a good way to make
the, the next set of

1193
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,760
features you build be not as
good as the first ones.

1194
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,284
>> How about one more
question?

1195
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:09,953
>> Yeah.

1196
00:45:09,953 --> 00:45:10,809
Yes?

1197
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:14,785
>> How do you give good user
feedback, if you're a user?

1198
00:45:14,785 --> 00:45:16,996
>> so, how do you give good
user feedback,

1199
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:18,693
it's a really good question.

1200
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:23,276
So I think what I, what I want
a user to do is I

1201
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:28,092
want a user to tell me about
what they, like,

1202
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:32,147
what they're really thinking,
right?

1203
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,831
And what, what, what they're
problems really are.

1204
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,430
And to just sort of ramble.

1205
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,500
Like I want someone to just
tell,

1206
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,230
tell me about stuff in their
life.

1207
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,580
Because the, the more you
learn about them as a person.

1208
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,020
And sort of the, the, their,

1209
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,784
what's going on in the context
of what they're doing the is

1210
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:52,430
easier to understand why they
want the things they want.

1211
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,770
And that's really the critical
question.

1212
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,600
So I'd say like, you know,
what I'm looking for in a,

1213
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,710
in someone, when I'm doing a
user interview, it's someone

1214
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,220
who is going to be willing to
talk a lot and be willing to,

1215
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,130
to really give me a full, give
me a full picture.

1216
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,200
So that's what, I guess on the
flip side,

1217
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,614
if you want to be a good, if
you want to help people out

1218
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:13,778
with good user interview
feedback ramble, like, be,

1219
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:16,276
just, just talk about stuff
and everything.

1220
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:17,138
All right, great.

1221
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:17,874
Well, thank you very much.

1222
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:18,527
>> Thank you very much.
