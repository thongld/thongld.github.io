284
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,260
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP176MBG9Tk
in things in front of a user
you should really have your

285
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,790
simple product positioning
down.

286
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,400
And what I mean by that is
that you know,

287
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
you should be able to go to
you know a person, and

288
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,490
you should be able to say,
hey you know this does x, y,

289
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,030
and z within a sentence.

290
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,860
And so for example you know,
at Homejoy we started off

291
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,790
with something actually
super complicated.

292
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,660
We're like we're an online
platform for home services.

293
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,465
We started with cleaning and
you can choose you know,

294
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,640
blah, and it just went off
for

295
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,770
paragraphs and paragraphs.

296
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,650
We were present and we want
to you

297
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,400
know potential users to come
onto our platform.

298
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,675
They just get kinda get
bored after that first

299
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,810
few sentences.

300
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,010
And so what we found out was
that we really need this one

301
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,460
liner, the one liner is very
important an it kinda

302
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,208
describes the functional
benefit of what you do,

303
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,250
you know, in the future when
your trying to build a brand

304
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,770
you should, you know, be
able to describe, you know,

305
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,640
what are emotional benefits
and stuff like that.

306
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,680
But, you're starting with
new users, you really need

307
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,210
to tell them what they're
gonna get out of it.

308
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,930
So we simply, after we
changed our positioning to

309
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,975
get your place clean for

310
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:52,090
$20 an hour, then everyone
got it, and we're able to

311
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,860
get you know users to, users
in the door that way.

312
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,020
So you have a MVP going out
there now how

313
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,180
do you get your first few
users to start trying it.

314
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,790
So your first few users
should be you know,

315
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,570
the obvious people,

316
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,580
the people that you're
connected with.

317
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,800
You should use it obviously,
you and

318
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,280
your co-founder should be
using it.

319
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,670
Your mom and dad should be
using it.

320
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,530
Your friends and co-workers
should be using it.

321
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,060
Beyond that you wanna get
more user feedback, and

322
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,890
so you, and I've listed here
kind of some of

323
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,280
the obvious places to go to.

324
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,200
And depending on what you're
selling, you know,

325
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,448
you can take your pick of
the, pick of the draw here.

326
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:39,872
So online communities
there's, you know,

327
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:42,179
on Hacker News now, there's
the show HM.

328
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,906
That's a great place
especially if

329
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:45,978
you're building tools for
developers and

330
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:46,906
things like that.

331
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,435
Local communities, so

332
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,035
if you're building consumer
product,

333
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:54,703
you know, there are a lot of
influential local community

334
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:58,525
mailing lists, especially
those for you know, parents,

335
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:02,276
so those are places you
might want to head up to.

336
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,297
okay.

337
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:06,553
So when you go to by the
way, home joy,

338
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:09,000
we actually tried all of
these.

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,180
So, we use it ourself, that
was fine,

340
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,150
I mean we were on a cleaner,
so that was pretty easy.

341
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,660
And then our parents lived
in Milwaukee and

342
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,850
so we were basically not
used to that in the work.

343
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,570
Friends and coworkers are
kinda like in

344
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,540
San Francisco and else
where, so

345
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,520
we didn't have too many of
them use it.

346
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,500
So we actually, if we ended
up in a dead end

347
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,450
of, not being about to
convince many people to

348
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,200
use this in the beginning.

349
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,240
So what we did was because
we are in Mountain View,

350
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,160
some of you might know on
Caster Street they have

351
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,180
street fairs there during
the summer time.

352
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,520
And so we'd go out and

353
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,730
basically chase down people
and

354
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,390
try to get them to book a
cleaning.

355
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,920
And almost everyone would
say no.

356
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,400
Until one day, we just took
advantage.

357
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,170
You know, it was a very hot
and humid day.

358
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,820
And what we noticed was, you
know, and

359
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,590
this was like any, at any
fair people you know,

360
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,480
there might be arts and
crafts and things like that.

361
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,240
And random people will you
know,

362
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,340
gravitate towards that, but

363
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,780
everybody gravitates towards
the food and drink area.

364
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,430
Especially on a hot day.

365
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,120
So what we did was, okay, we
figured we need to get in

366
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,200
the middle of that, and by
getting in the middle of

367
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,440
that we just took water
bottles, froze them and

368
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,490
then we started handing out
free bottles of water that

369
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,880
were cold, and people just
came to us.

370
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
I think we just basically
guilt tripped people

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,370
into booking cleanings.

372
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,310
But the proof in the pudding
was that I figured most of

373
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,840
those people were guilt
tripped into doing it,

374
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,560
but, when they went home
they didn't cancel on us.

375
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,330
Well, some of them did,

376
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,240
but, a maj, majority of them
did not.

377
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,660
And, so, we felt, like, I, I
thought, okay,

378
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,720
that's good I gotta go clean
their houses, but, at least,

379
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,488
you know, there's something
we're actually solving here.

380
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:53,470
so, and, you know, I don't
suggest,

381
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,090
I think showing up the
fares, or another start up

382
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,110
in the last batch, I forgot
their name right now,

383
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,990
but they, they, they, they
showed up,

384
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,092
they, they were selling
shipping type products.

385
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,150
Or were trying to replace
shipping products or

386
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,500
the content and mailing
stuff.

387
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,733
And so they would show up to
the U.S. Postal Office and

388
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,780
find people who were trying
to ship products.

389
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,980
And just take them out of
line.

390
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,220
Try to get them to use your
product.

391
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,600
Have them ship it for you.

392
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,010
So, you just have to go to
places where people

393
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,040
are going to really show up,
and, you know,

394
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,090
your conversion rate is
gonna be really, really low,

395
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,580
but to go from zero to one
to three to four, these

396
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,790
are the kind of things, you
might have to do.

397
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,350
Okay.

398
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,440
So, you got some users using
you.

399
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,900
Now what do you do with all
these users?

400
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,200
Customer feedback.

401
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,900
So, one, the first thing you
should do

402
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,580
is make sure there's a way
for people to contact you.

403
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,150
So, support@homejoy.com.

404
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:01,840
Ideally there's a phone
number, and if you hook up

405
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,880
a phone number, one really
good idea is to, make sure

406
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,480
that, you have voice mail or
something like that, so

407
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,210
you don't have to be picking
it up all the time.

408
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,540
But in any case, a way for
people to get inbound,

409
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,410
to get inbound feedback is
good, but really what you

410
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,480
should be doing is going out
to your users and

411
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,730
talking with them, you know.

412
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,970
Get away from your desk and

413
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,570
just get out and do the
work.

414
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,350
It seems like a slog and
it's going to be a slog, but

415
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,510
this is where you're going
to get the best feedback

416
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,280
ever for your product.

417
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,830
And this is gonna teach you
on what features you need to

418
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,480
completely change, get rid
of,

419
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
or what features you need to
build.

420
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,360
And so, one way to do this
is to send out surveys, you

421
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,730
know, to get reviews after
they've used the product.

422
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,450
This is okay, but generally,
you know, people are only

423
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,520
gonna respond if they really
love you or really hate you.

424
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,900
And, you never get like the
in between, So kind of

425
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,120
get in between not get all
the extremes is to go out

426
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,660
an actually meet the person
that is using your product.

427
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,470
And, it's not a good idea
to,

428
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,690
you know, I've seen people
go out meet the user and

429
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,820
they sit there and it's like
a laboratory and

430
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,690
it's like an inquisition
almost?

431
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,450
And you're kind of just like
poking, and poking, and

432
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,360
poking at them like why'd
you do that?

433
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,400
Why'd you do that?

434
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,150
That's not going to give you
the best results.

435
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,950
What you should really do is
make it into a conversation.

436
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,670
Get to know them, get them
to feel comfortable,

437
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,870
because you want to get them
at a level where they are,

438
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,162
they feel like, you know,

439
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:37,770
they should be honest with
you to help you an, an,

440
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,490
and improve, improve things
for you.

441
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,480
So I found that actually
taking people out for

442
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,460
drinks and stuff like that
was a very good

443
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,780
way to do that.

444
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,830
I'm not sure if all of you
are old enough to do that,

445
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,000
but you can take them for
coffee.

446
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,330
So another way,

447
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,070
another thing you should be
tracking is.

448
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,480
How are you doing in
general,

449
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,260
like from like the macro
perspective.

450
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,580
And the best way to do that
is by tracking

451
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,430
customer retention.

452
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,410
That is, the number of
people that came in the door

453
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,720
today, how many are coming
back tomorrow, the next day,

454
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,580
and so on and so forth.

455
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,822
Usually over time you're
kinda looking at,

456
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:16,750
you know, monthly retention
so.

457
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,857
You know, people who came in
the door today are they

458
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,900
still using it next month
and so and so forth.

459
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,760
The problem with that
metri,c is that it's you

460
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,940
know, it takes forever to
collect that data.

461
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,750
And you don't have,

462
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,595
sometimes you don't have a
month or two months or

463
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,790
three months to, you know,
to figure that out.

464
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,477
So good leading indicator is
actually collecting reviews

465
00:20:34,477 --> 00:20:37,620
and ratings like five star,
four star reviews.

466
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,730
Are collecting some notion
of

467
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,930
NPS which is Net Promoter
Score.

468
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,130
So you're basically asking
them

469
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,600
from a rating from zero to
ten,

470
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,690
how likely are they to
recommend you to a friend.

471
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,590
And calculating the NPS.

472
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,940
And so over time what you'll
see is,

473
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,570
as you're building a new
feature, is you should be

474
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,560
able to see that the reviews
or the retention is going up

475
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,910
over time which means you're
doing a good job.

476
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,730
If it's going down,

477
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,720
you're doing a bad job, and
if it's kind of staying

478
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,580
the same that means you
probably need to go out and

479
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,300
figure out what new things
you should be building.

480
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,120
The other thing is,

481
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,310
I'll get to the qualitative
thing later, but

482
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,090
the one thing you should be
worried of is the honesty

483
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,010
curve, which is some people
will just lie to you.

484
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:30,490
So, I mean, this is

485
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,790
like degrees of separation
from you, and

486
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,350
this is like level of
honesty.

487
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,900
Like so here it's, here this
is your mom.

488
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,248
This is like your friends of
friends and

489
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:47,180
here's like random people.

490
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,580
I don't know if you can all
see this but, so

491
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,998
you're mom is going to be
you know.

492
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:56,640
They, she should use your
product, but

493
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,070
she's going to be proud of
you anyway, and so

494
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,760
she'll maybe be honest like
this much.

495
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,390
And your friends will, you
know,

496
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,561
they'll be pretty honest
with you and

497
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,940
give you feedback because
they care about you.

498
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,230
By the way, this is assuming
it's

499
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,537
a free product that you're
giving them.

500
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:11,660
>> And.

501
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,740
Then over time, like as you
get more and more random,

502
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,790
these people don't even know
who you are, it doesn't go

503
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,670
like this really, but it
kind of goes like this.

504
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,270
Where people don't care
about giving you

505
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,670
feedback they just like okay
here's a survey, ta, ta, ta,

506
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,540
tat and so you should take

507
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,460
this into consideration when
getting user feedback.

508
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,760
Now let's say you make, you
pay.

509
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,020
It's a pay product, right?

510
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,928
Well let's just do this in
green.

511
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:38,040
So, the paid, you know,

512
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,530
your mom is gonna be like
down here.

513
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,900
Like, she's just gonna lie
to you and say, you know,

514
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,800
she's just gonna feel sorry
and

515
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,610
say, this is a great product
of course.

516
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,160
But then you, kind of goes
like this, right?

517
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,220
Which is to say that your
friends are kinda gonna

518
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,340
give you the right, they're,
they wanna support you and

519
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,500
give you the right feedback.

520
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,590
But it's actually these
random people up here that,

521
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,600
you know, if they,

522
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,320
if they really don't think
what they paid for

523
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,370
was worth it, they're gonna
really tell you.

524
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,308
Because you know, it's money
out the door.

525
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,550
And so, this is another way
of saying you're going to

526
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,530
get the best feedback.

527
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,110
Obviously, down here, you're
gonna get more feedback

528
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,850
if you just make someone pay
for it.

529
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,540
That's not to say you
should, you know, and

530
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,630
the first time make out make
people pay for it.

531
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,980
That it is to say that you
should, if you're going to

532
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,680
build a product that you're
going to eventually need to,

533
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,830
you know, they're going to
pay for the software or

534
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,860
for the hardware, whatever,
you should do that.

535
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,530
Get to the point where you
can do that very, very fast.

536
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,560
Because then that's when you
get

537
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,300
the real meaty stuff to help
you in the future of

538
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,320
how you can get more paying
users in the door.

539
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,420
All right so, you're getting
a lot of feedback and,

540
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,210
what do you do before you
laun,

541
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,050
officially launch the
product?

542
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,650
So what you want to do is,

543
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,640
you always want to be
building fast, right?

544
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,250
And you want to be
optimizing for

545
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,000
this stage of growth.

546
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,102
That is you,

547
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,990
you know, you might have ten
users at this point.

548
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,360
Don't, theres no point in
trying to build features for

549
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,320
the point when you have a
million users.

550
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,210
You want to optimize for the
next stage of growth,

551
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,440
which is gonna be ten to a
hundred users.

552
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,720
What are features you really
need for

553
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,736
that and just go with that.

554
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,223
Some times.

555
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:35,790
And basically on the slide
is just many ways of

556
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,890
stating that notion.

557
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,080
Manual before automation.

558
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,930
One of the things that I
found when

559
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,210
building a market place is
that process is very,

560
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,460
very important over time as
you scale.

561
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,560
But you need not try to
automate everything and

562
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,070
create software to just have
robots just run everything.

563
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,920
What you should really do to
understand what you

564
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,190
should really build, is to
manually do it yourself.

565
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,880
And an example of this is
when we started taking

566
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,900
on cleaning professionals
onto our platform.
