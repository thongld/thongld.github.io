772
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,250
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Dl8rZ6qwE
like it's never gonna work,
and so

773
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,411
you have to sort of create
these abstracted units, or

774
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:52,247
that's at least what we're
gonna try to do.

775
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,741
And at Pinterest in
particular, the real

776
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,811
challenge of creating those
abstracted units is.

777
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:59,296
We want to actually have

778
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:02,419
units that encompass a
super-strong designer,

779
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,060
a super-strong leader in
engineering, often a writer,

780
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,830
often sometimes like a
community manager.

781
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,890
We want them all to be
self-contained.

782
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,190
And so that makes the
problem really hard,

783
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,860
but that's kind of core to
our philosophy of how we

784
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,480
build products.

785
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,560
We try to put people
together that have all of

786
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,520
these different disciplines.

787
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,056
They're curious about lots
of things.

788
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,680
And then we anchor them on a
single project and then we

789
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,115
try to remove barriers to
let them go fast.

790
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,940
When we find new barriers,
we sit down and

791
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,180
we think, how do we speed
that up?

792
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,850
I think hiring is a little
bit different.

793
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,710
And I think the biggest
change and

794
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,200
the biggest asset that you
get as you get more

795
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,890
people is referrals become
like more and more and

796
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,660
more and more the life blood
depending on

797
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,998
the network of all the
people that you bring in.

798
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:43,380
So one of the really lucky,

799
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,087
and in hindsight, great
decisions that we made, was

800
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,794
actually the 14th or 15th
person that we hired was

801
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:51,888
a professional recruiter and
she had worked at start-ups.

802
00:30:51,888 --> 00:30:54,580
She had worked at big
companies like Apple.

803
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,672
But she knew where that
pipeline breaks down,

804
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,812
knew the early indicators,
and

805
00:30:59,812 --> 00:31:03,460
taught everyone not just how
to screen for talent, but

806
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,949
how scalably to identify the
people that are gonna be

807
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,900
culturally, really good for
the company.

808
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,076
And I think looking back on
that,

809
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:15,350
it's something that I
personally really value.

810
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,894
>> You know, there's just a
huge amount of

811
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:18,495
stuff here, right?

812
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:19,632
In that I guess,

813
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:23,408
this is all under kinda the
rubric of managing growth.

814
00:31:23,408 --> 00:31:27,737
And either your company
fails very quickly or all of

815
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:31,210
your problems become in some
way about managing growth.

816
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,030
One thing that I think tends
to take people by surprise,

817
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,550
and certainly took me by
surprise,

818
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,330
is kind of how quickly just
like the time

819
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,370
horizon has changed.

820
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,720
In that, in your first month
you're largely thinking

821
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,660
about things maybe one month
ahead, right?

822
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,168
In that, maybe that's kind
of

823
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:52,721
what your development road
map is oriented around,

824
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,820
even in terms of who you're
working with.

825
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,370
Maybe it's like,

826
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,280
informal relationships where
they haven't fully committed

827
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,160
to remain full time or
whatever, right?

828
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,372
And then, the more time goes
by,

829
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:05,058
I think that kind of has a
reciprocal, or

830
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:08,220
corresponding increase in
the time horizons.

831
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,920
After one year, you're kind
of thinking one year ahead.

832
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,675
After four years, you're
thinking four years ahead.

833
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:16,870
But that increases very
quickly, right?

834
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,879
And so after you know,

835
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:20,440
it's after one month, it's
again, super short term.

836
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,180
And then just 11 months
later you should now

837
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,650
actually be thinking and
planning a year ahead, and

838
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,250
thinking about human
structures on

839
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,162
that time horizon.

840
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:31,315
Thinking about the stuff Ben
talked about, like where you

841
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:34,530
want to be going long term
and things like that.

842
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,773
I think that also plays into
your hiring and

843
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,775
the kinds of people you
hire, right?

844
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,499
In that in the really early
days you kind of

845
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,322
have to hire people who will
be productive,

846
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:43,520
essentially immediately.

847
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,812
You don't have the luxury of
hiring people who are really

848
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:50,496
promising, but they're not
quite gonna be up to

849
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:52,420
speed for another year or
two.

850
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,090
They have to be able to
contribute immediately.

851
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,330
But after two or three
years, now it starts to get

852
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,550
much more reasonable to make
those investments and

853
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,110
in fact, if you're not
making those investments,

854
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,380
you're probably being much
too short term.

855
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,060
And so I think that's really
important.

856
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,880
And a lot of it also just
comes from

857
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,355
all these problems in some
sense are easy,

858
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,240
like how do you build good
social bonds between people?

859
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,795
I mean, we all do it every
day, right?

860
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,355
It's kind of, how do you
make it systematic and

861
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:22,968
effective at scale?

862
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,597
It's always a very severely
imperfect approximation of

863
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:29,620
what you would ideally do if
you were small, and

864
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,566
what hacks can you pull to
make it work as well as

865
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:35,460
you possibly can at a larger
scale.

866
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,804
Like a rapidly growing
company,

867
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:38,244
say growing headcount here,
two or

868
00:33:38,244 --> 00:33:40,412
three x a year, it is a very
unnatural thing.

869
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:43,327
And so it's, what's the
least bad way of sort of

870
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:45,370
managing that period of
growth?

871
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,620
Human organizations aren't
designed for

872
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,240
it and I think it's worth
being quite systematic about

873
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
thinking about ways to do
that.

874
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,650
But realizing that you
probably can't do

875
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,420
much better than adequation.

876
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,464
You know, for Stripe, it's
things like we

877
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:03,120
have three meals every day
at sort of

878
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,008
long tables where everyone
can sit together, right?

879
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:09,190
And if you think of net, how
much more total human

880
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,169
interaction happens as a
result of having these kind

881
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:15,233
of randomly mixed meals,
it's vast, right?

882
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:17,900
And it's kind of a whole
list of things like that.

883
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,260
But, I think that's kind of
the general framework.

884
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,500
>> One thing I'm really
curious about you guys value

885
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,053
transparency.

886
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:26,577
How have you scaled it over
time?

887
00:34:26,577 --> 00:34:28,320
I know we think about
figuring it out all

888
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,318
the time, just curious.

889
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:33,404
>> So you know, start-ups, I
can't remember who it was,

890
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,576
defined it as a, start-up is
an organization that's not

891
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,510
yet stuck with all of these
principle agent problems.

892
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,616
That at most large
companies,

893
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:47,261
what is locally optimal for
you is very frequently not

894
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:50,204
what is globally optimal for
the company.

895
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:56,850
And so there are, as a
consequence of that,

896
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,480
probably a lot of ways in
which a start-up can

897
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,270
work differently to a big
company.

898
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,130
At a big company, a lot of
the things that are good for

899
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,460
you, well, you couldn't do
them in

900
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,640
a completely transparent
environment, right?

901
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,350
Because people would think
less of you or

902
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,180
you're doing things you're
not supposed to.

903
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,005
But because everyone is kind
of sailing in the, or

904
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,916
rowing in the same direction
at a start-up, you can

905
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,022
actually just make all of
the information transparent.

906
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:23,369
And so, I guess I mentioned
earlier, Stripe used to BCC

907
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,626
every other person at Stripe
on basically every single

908
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:31,789
outgoing email unless you
opted out of it, because we

909
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,230
thought that would be much
more efficient.

910
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,470
You wouldn't need to have as
many meetings,

911
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,370
if you just kind of keep
abreast of what's happening.

912
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,590
And over time we've sort of
built an increasingly

913
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,700
intricate framework of
mailing lists and

914
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,680
we now have a program for
generating Gmail filters.

915
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,390
And for like a pretty rocky
patch where 50 people or

916
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,840
so, to Ben's point of like,
asking people how they're

917
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,380
getting on after the first
couple of days.

918
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,671
They're reported terribly
because like they couldn't

919
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:00,722
even find all the emails
that people were sending to

920
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:03,710
them and they were missing
things and everything.

921
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,080
>> Gmail broke at one stage.

922
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,584
>> Oh, right, at one point
Gmail broke because we

923
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,838
were just like sending too
much email.

924
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,804
It is hard to scale, because
I mean,

925
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:15,210
you might contact somebody
outside of the company with

926
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,657
like some great idea, and
maybe the person

927
00:36:18,657 --> 00:36:22,776
sitting across the way from
you thinks that's like

928
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:26,818
the stupidest idea they've
ever heard, right?

929
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,124
And you're kind of subject
to the scrutiny of

930
00:36:29,124 --> 00:36:31,369
the entire organization, to
some degree,

931
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:33,080
with all of your
communication.

932
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,125
Like kind of the challenging
side of it.

933
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,110
Then the good side is people
are much more informed about

934
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,930
what's happening.

935
00:36:40,212 --> 00:36:45,312
I guess I don't feel that I
can give much

936
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:50,510
stronger endorsement of it
than it has worked so far.

937
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,216
>> That's a pretty good
endorsement.

938
00:36:52,216 --> 00:36:55,550
>> Yeah, I'm actually really
curious how or whether it'll

939
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,940
work when we're 5,000 people
or something like that.

940
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,950
If we're ever at that scale.

941
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,110
>> I think the two things
that have

942
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,400
helped us scale it are one,
changing the tools and

943
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,060
two, developing the culture
around it.

944
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,010
And so on the tools front,
you know,

945
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,760
used to be the case, or the
infrastructure, it

946
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,670
used to be the case that you
could keep abreast by what's

947
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,700
happening in the company by
reading all the email.

948
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,480
Now we have weekly all-hands
sometimes on the deck,

949
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,720
and we actually have to put
all this work into

950
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,830
developing a deck to, to
communicate to people what's

951
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,640
going on in the company,
since there's so much more.

952
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,820
And the second is on the
cultural side, so much

953
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,660
information being available
internally, you have to

954
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,950
develop cultural norms
around how it's treated.

955
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,680
Obvious things like the fact
that a lot of

956
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,590
it's confidential to Stripe.

957
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,260
But even less obvious things
like when emailing someone

958
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,190
or talking in Slack or

959
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,860
IRESE, when that is viewed
by now 170 people,

960
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,524
it's pretty easy to get
stage fright.

961
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:55,970
And it's, it's pretty easy
for what you thought was

962
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,110
a reasonable proposal, you
get this drive-by criticism.

963
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,890
And you're now less likely
to share in the future.

964
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,200
And so, we've had to create
norms around when it's

965
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,650
reasonable to jump into
discussions and

966
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,010
how that interaction works.

967
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,110
Because people are on the
stage so much more.

968
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,300
>> I'm pretty sure it's not
good,

969
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,530
but, not to put her on the
spot but

970
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,180
Emily interned at Stripe
this summer.

971
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,140
I'm curious, like,

972
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,480
as an intern, what you
thought of it?

973
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,920
>> I think, overall, it's
great.

974
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,351
I think, like, my first
week,

975
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:24,259
I spent most of the time
reading Hackpad and

976
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:26,670
getting caught up on what
the company was doing.

977
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,870
It can often be quite
distracting,

978
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,460
from your own work, as there
are oftentimes other parts

979
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,330
of the company you're really
interested in.

980
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,050
>> Hackpad, by the way, is
like Google Docs, but

981
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,760
with a news feed and

982
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,600
that way you can just like
see all the documents.

983
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,860
>> Yeah, and you're
encouraged to make

984
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,229
everything public,
everything you work on.

985
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,310
But overall, it gets you
spun up really quickly.

986
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,172
And we also have things
called spin ups where

987
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:47,990
every single leader of a
team at the company,

988
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,280
whether it's sys or it's
product gives like a 30

989
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,360
minute talk on what their
team is currently doing and

990
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
how you can contribute, if
you're interested.

991
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,925
>> Do you think email
transparency was net good?

992
00:38:56,925 --> 00:38:59,982
>> Yes I remember having a
hard time understanding what

993
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:02,410
I should and should not
subscribe too.

994
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,480
And the first week having
2,000 emails in my inbox and

995
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
then by the end there are
three of four teams you

996
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,940
actually want that
information coming in from.

997
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,903
>> All right, audience
questions.

998
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:14,971
Yes.

999
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:17,974
>> So this question for
Patrick and John.

1000
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:21,766
Is it your experience that
your early hires begin to

1001
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:22,383
grow and

1002
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:26,900
evolve into leadership roles
as the company scales?

1003
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,421
And a question for

1004
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:33,330
Ben, how is the difference,
what difference is today?

1005
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,660
How is a difference in your
initial bid run of

1006
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,630
the product and the audience
would be?

1007
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,080
>> All right, we'll go first
on.

1008
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,858
The people, actually all
three of you are welcome to

1009
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,050
answer this, have the people
that you

1010
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,960
hired early been able to
grow into leadership roles?

1011
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,470
>> In the Stripes case, yes,
in that quite a number of

1012
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,410
the first ten people are in
leadership roles now.

1013
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,610
I think that's one thing
that organizations, again

1014
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,548
it's an unnatural skill that
they have to get good at,

1015
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:05,800
is realizing that people
don't necessarily come out

1016
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,140
of the womb being good at
managing or being good at

1017
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,420
leadership and being able to
develop that in people, and

1018
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,510
being able to help people
progress as

1019
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,880
they spend a number of years
at the company.

1020
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,450
It's a lot of work at a time
when everyone is running

1021
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,730
around with their hair on
fire, but it's also damaging

1022
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,130
if the company can't develop
that skill.

1023
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,740
>> Yeah, I think for

1024
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,280
us the answer is some yes
and some no.

1025
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,320
I think one of the big
benefits of

1026
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,690
working at a start-up is
that you can be

1027
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,310
handed a challenge that no
one else would be

1028
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,340
crazy enough to give you the
opportunity to take on.
