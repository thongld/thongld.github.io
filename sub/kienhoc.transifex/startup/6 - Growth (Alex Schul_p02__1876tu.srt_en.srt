260
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,300
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno
Different verticals need
different terminal retention

261
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,580
rates for them to have
successful businesses.

262
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,610
If you're in e-commerce and
you're retaining on

263
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,160
a monthly active basis like
20, 30% of your users,

264
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,340
you're probably gonna do
pretty well.

265
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,560
If you're in social media,
and

266
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,260
your first batch of people
signing up to

267
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,850
your product are not like
80% retained,

268
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,630
you're not gonna have a
massive social media site.

269
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,920
And so, it really depends on
the vertical you're in,

270
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,540
what the retention rates
are.

271
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,450
What you need to do is have
the tools to

272
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,690
think about who out there is
comparable.

273
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,377
And how you can look at it
and say,

274
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:50,030
am I anywhere close to what
real success looks like in

275
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,888
this vertical?

276
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:54,429
So retention is

277
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,370
the single most important
thing for growth.

278
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,150
And retention comes from
having a great idea, and

279
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,030
a great product to back up
that idea and

280
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,960
great product market fit.

281
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,530
The way we look at whether a
product has great retention

282
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,490
or not is whether or not the
users who install it.

283
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,420
Actually stay on it long
term,

284
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,640
when you normalize on a
cohort basis, and

285
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
I think that's a really good
methodology for

286
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,100
looking at your product and
saying, okay, the first 100,

287
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,690
the first 1,000, the first
10,000 people I get on this,

288
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,400
will they be retained in the
long run?

289
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,240
So now how do you attack
operating for growth?

290
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,730
Let's say you have awesome
product market fit.

291
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,240
You have built an e-commerce
site and you have 60% of

292
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,230
people coming back every
single month and

293
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,260
making a purchase from you.

294
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,790
Which would be absolutely
fantastic.

295
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,650
How do you take that and say
now it's time to scale?

296
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,640
Now it's time to

297
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,240
execute was the last thing
in your thought.

298
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,920
Right?

299
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,330
And that's where I think
growth teams come in.

300
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,280
Like my contrarian
viewpoint, or

301
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,740
whatever is if you're a
start-up you

302
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,890
shouldn't have a growth
team.

303
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,304
>> Damn it.

304
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,900
So close.

305
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,670
Halfway through and I
failed.

306
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,045
You shouldn't have a growth
team.

307
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,220
Start-ups should not have
growth teams.

308
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,020
The whole company should be
the growth team.

309
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,280
The CEO.

310
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,610
Should be the head of
growth.

311
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,620
You need someone to set a
North Star for

312
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,910
you, gratuitous shot of the,
you know, NASA page.

313
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,930
You need someone to set a
North Star for

314
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,920
you about where the company
wants to go.

315
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,240
And that person needs to be
the person leading

316
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,630
the company, in my opinion,
from what I've seen.

317
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,420
And Mark is a fantastic
example of that.

318
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,490
Back when Facebook started
lots of people were

319
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,840
putting out their registered
user numbers.

320
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,020
Right?
You'd see registered user

321
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,770
numbers for MySpace.

322
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,120
You'd see registered user
numbers for Compact.

323
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
You'd see registered user
numbers.

324
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,430
Mark put out monthly active
users as the number both

325
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,410
internally he held everyone
to.

326
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,180
And said we need everyone on
Facebook, but

327
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,060
that means everyone active
on Facebook.

328
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,770
Not everyone signed up to
Facebook.

329
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,640
So monthly active people was
the number internally.

330
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,650
And it was also the number
he published externally.

331
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,120
It was the number he made
the whole world hold

332
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,860
Facebook to as the number
that we cared about.

333
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,960
If you look at what Yam has
done with What's Up I

334
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,710
think it's another great
example.

335
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,140
He always published send
numbers.

336
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,490
If you're a messaging
application,

337
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,120
sends is probably the single
most important number.

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,030
If people use you once a
day.

339
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,420
Maybe that's great, but they
send one message.

340
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,510
They, you're not really
their primary messaging

341
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,190
mechanism, so Yan published
the sentence number.

342
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,770
Right?

343
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,180
Inside AvianB they talk
about nice book, and

344
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,540
they also published that in
all of the,

345
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,740
like, infographics that you
see inside Tech Crunch.

346
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,250
They always benchmark
themselves against how many

347
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,970
nights booked they

348
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,440
have compared to the largest
hotel chains in the world.

349
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,420
They have, each of these
companies,

350
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,080
a different north star.

351
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,350
The north start doesn't have
to be

352
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,850
monthly active users for
every different vertical.

353
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,920
For eBay, when I was there,

354
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,230
it was gross merchandised
volume.

355
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,320
How much stuff did people
actually buy through eBay.

356
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,640
Everyone externally tends to
judge eBay based on revenue.

357
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Actually, Benedict Evans has

358
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,870
done this amazing breakdown
of Amazon's business.

359
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,890
Which is really interesting.

360
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,700
To look at their marketplace
business versus their

361
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,790
direct business.

362
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,020
EBay is all marketplace
business, right.

363
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,760
So eBay's being judged by
its revenue when it

364
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,010
actually has ten times, or
whatever more

365
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,610
gross merchandised volume
going through the site.

366
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,590
And that was the number that
eBay looked at when I

367
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,540
was inside there, and
optimized for.

368
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,970
So every different company
when it

369
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,970
thinks about growth needs a
different north star.

370
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,550
But when you are operating
for

371
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,310
growth, it is critical that
you have that north star and

372
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,370
you define it as a leader.

373
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,440
The reason this matters is.

374
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,020
The second you have more
than one person working on

375
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,600
anything, you cannot control
what everyone else is doing.

376
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,270
Right?

377
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,940
I promise you,

378
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,450
having now might have hit
100 people I'm managing,

379
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,960
I have no control.

380
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
It's all influence.

381
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,820
Yes, I can say to one
person, do this one thing.

382
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,420
But then the other 99

383
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,090
are gonna do whatever the
hell they want.

384
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,090
And the thing is, it's not
clear to everybody what

385
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,470
the most important thing is
a for a company.

386
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,010
It would be very easy inside
eBay for

387
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,070
people to say, you know
what?

388
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,250
We should focus on revenue.

389
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,921
Or you know what?
We should focus on

390
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:04,928
the number of people buying
from us.

391
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,901
Or you know what?
We should focus on

392
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:06,873
how many people list items
on eBay.

393
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,880
And Pierre and Meg and John.

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,460
Those guys, those various
leaders, always said no,

395
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,160
it's the amount of gross
merchandise volume that

396
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,960
goes through our site.

397
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,895
It's the percentage of

398
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,740
e-commerce that goes through
our site.

399
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,402
That is what really matters
for this company.

400
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,420
Which means when people are
having a conversation and

401
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,220
you're not in the room, when
they're sitting in front of

402
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,410
their computer screen and
thinking about how they

403
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,690
build this particular
product or

404
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,140
this particular feature.

405
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,980
In their head,

406
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,290
it's gonna be clear to them
that it's not about revenue.

407
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,270
It's about gross merchandise
volume.

408
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,250
Or it's not about getting
more registrations.

409
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,300
Registrations don't matter
unless they become long term

410
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,940
active users.

411
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,480
A great example of this is
when I was at Ebay in 2004.

412
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,933
We changed the way we paid
our affiliates for

413
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:50,874
new users.

414
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:53,822
And affiliate programs are a
bit out of fashion these

415
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:54,425
days, but

416
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:57,307
the idea of an affiliate
program is essentially you

417
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:58,925
pay anyone on the internet.

418
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,246
A referral for sending
traffic to your site.

419
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,384
But it's mostly about
getting access to like,

420
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,041
big marketers who do it on
their own,

421
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:06,950
like separately and

422
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,550
some really good stories
from this.

423
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,480
We were paying for confirmed
registered users.

424
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,282
So all of our affiliates
were aligned,

425
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,360
they're out getting
confirmed registered users,

426
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,370
to the base site.

427
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,910
We changed our payment model
to pay for

428
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,470
activated confirmed
registered users.

429
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,440
So you had to confirm your
account and

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,150
then bid on an item, or buy
an item or

431
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,170
list an item, to become
someone that we paid for.

432
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,080
Overnight when we made that
change,

433
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,160
we lost something like 20%
of confirmed registered

434
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,090
users that were being driven
by the affiliates.

435
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,816
But the ACIUs only dropped
by about 5%.

436
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,427
The ratio of CIU to ACIU
went up, and

437
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:54,270
then the growth of ACIUs,
massively accelerated.

438
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,200
The cause of this was if you
wanna drive CRUs if

439
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,030
someone searches for

440
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,680
a trampoline, you land them
on the registration page cuz

441
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,100
they think they have to
register and

442
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,150
confirm, before they get
that trampoline.

443
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,855
If you wanna drive ACRUs you
land them on the search

444
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,210
results page within eBay for
trampolines so they can see

445
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,970
the thing they want to buy,
get excited about it and

446
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,170
register when they want to
buy it.

447
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,480
And if you drive just CRUs
people don't

448
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,350
have an amazing,

449
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,930
magic moment on eBay when
they visit the site.

450
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,600
And that's the next most
important thing to

451
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,220
think about, is how do you
drive towards the magic

452
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,590
moment that gets people
hooked on your service?

453
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,010
So in the lecture notes for

454
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,350
this course I've stuck in a
bunch of links to people I

455
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,470
think are brilliant at all
of this stuff.

456
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,450
That retention curve I
showed earlier,

457
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,650
there's a link to this guy
Danny Ferrante

458
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,650
whose incredible talking
about retention curves.

459
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,716
The magic moment, there are
two videos linked.

460
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,400
One is Chimoff talking about
growth,

461
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,820
who was the guy who set up
the growth team at Facebook.

462
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,614
And one is my friend Naomi
and

463
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,857
I talking at F8 four years
ago about how we

464
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:57,986
were thinking about growth
back then.

465
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,267
And in both of those mem,

466
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,480
both of those videos we talk
about the magic moment.

467
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,390
So, what do you guys think
the magic moment is for

468
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,560
when you're signing up to
Facebook?

469
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,080
You hit that big green
button,

470
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,124
what is the moment when
users are like ha?

471
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,730
Mark even talked about it at
the start up

472
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,820
school a few years back.

473
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,680
>> See your friends.

474
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,610
>> See your friends.

475
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,060
Simple as that.

476
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,400
And usually it is very
simple.

477
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,670
I talked to so many
companies, and they try and

478
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,180
get incredibly complicated
about what they're doing.

479
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,560
But it is as simple as just
when you see that

480
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,460
first picture of one of your
friends on Facebook.

481
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,300
You go, oh my God, this is
what the site is about.

482
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,573
And Zucks talked at Y
Combinator about

483
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,340
getting people to ten
friends in 14 days.

484
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,760
That is why we focus on that
metric.

485
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,520
The number one most
important thing in

486
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,270
a social media site is
connecting to your friends.

487
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,085
Because without that,

488
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,650
you have a completely empty
news feed, and

489
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,100
clearly you're not gonna
come back.

490
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,420
You'll never get any
notifications,

491
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,770
you'll never have any
friends telling you

492
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,660
about things they're missing
on the site.

493
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,640
So for Facebook the magic
moment is that moment when

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,100
you see your friend's face,
and

495
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,580
everything we do on growth.

496
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,330
And if you look at the
LinkedIn registration flow,

497
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,850
or you look at the Twitter
registration flow,

498
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,320
or you look at what WhatsApp
does when you sign up,

499
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
the number one thing all
these services look to

500
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,550
do is to show you the people
you want to follow,

501
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,540
connect to, send messages
to, as quickly as possible.

502
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,339
Because in this vertical,
that's what matters.

503
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,990
When you think about Airbnb
or you think about eBay,

504
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,750
it's finding on eBay that
unique item,

505
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,000
that PEZ dispenser or broken
laser pointer that you

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,930
really, really cared about,
and wanted to get hold of.

507
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,530
Like when you see that
collectible thing that you

508
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,000
were missing, that is the
real magic moment on eBay.

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,370
When you look on Airbnb and

510
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,150
you find that first, you
find that,

511
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,750
that first listing that's
like a cool house that you

512
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,360
can stay in and

513
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,660
when you go through the
door, that's a magic moment.

514
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,800
And similarly on the other
side,

515
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
when you're listing your
house,

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,660
the first time you get paid,
is an amazing moment.

517
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,880
When you're listing an item
on eBay,

518
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,860
the first time you get paid
is a magic moment.
