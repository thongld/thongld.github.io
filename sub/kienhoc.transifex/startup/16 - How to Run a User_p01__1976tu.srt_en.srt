All right, good afternoon.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,303
Today's guest speaker is
Emmett Shear,

3
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:06,796
Emmett is the CEO of Twitch.

4
00:00:06,796 --> 00:00:08,236
>> Hello.
>> Which was acquired by

5
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:09,892
Amazon, where he now works.

6
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:14,460
And Emmett is going to do a
new formal of class today, and

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,320
talk about how to do great
user interviews?

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,040
So this is the talking to
users part

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,490
of starting a startup, should
be really useful.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,880
Thank you very much for
coming.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,380
>> Thanks Tim.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,110
>> Contact server knows where
I'm coming from, from this.

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,940
We started our, I started my
first startup with Justin Kan

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,370
right out of college we,

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,030
started this company called
Kiko Calendar It didn't go so

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,850
well, it, it went, all right.

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,320
We, we, we built it we sold
it, but we sold it on Ebay so

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,000
that's not necessarily, the
end you want for

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,090
your startup,
>> And

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,800
It was it was a good time.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
We learned a lot, we learned a
lot about programming.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,540
We didn't know anything about
calendars,

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,730
neither of us were users of
calendars nor did we.

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,420
During the period of time,
we're thinking you've got to

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,150
talk to anyone who actually
did use a calendar.

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,440
So that was, that was not
optimal.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,180
we, we got the build stuff
part of the, startup down,

28
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,640
we did not get the talk to
users part.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,020
The second startup we started
we used, a very common trick,

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,890
that lets you get away with
not talking to users,

31
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,950
which is that we were our own
consumer.

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,390
We, we had this idea for a
television show, Justin TV,

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,790
a reality show about Justin
Kan's life.

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,970
And we built a whole set of
technology and

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,020
website around the reality
show we wanted to run.

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,760
And so we were the user for
that for that product.

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,320
And that's actually one way to
cheat and

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,710
get away with not talking to
many other users is if you're

39
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,800
just building something that
literally is just for you.

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,540
You don't need to talk to

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,740
anyone else because you know
what is you want.

42
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,810
And what you need.

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,370
But that's if you're really
limiting,

44
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,249
where to start a startup.

45
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,070
Most startups are not just
built for

46
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,490
the person who is who is using
them.

47
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,110
And when you do that, every
now and

48
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,920
then, you get really lucky.

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,800
And you are representative of
some huge class of

50
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,520
people who all want the exact
same thing you do.

51
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,360
But very often also that just
turns into

52
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,780
a side project that doesn't go
any where.

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,370
so, we kept working on
Justin.TV for a while and

54
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,730
we actually achieved a good
deal of success,

55
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,650
because it turned out that
there were

56
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,940
people out there who wanted to
do the same thing we did.

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,590
Which was broadcast ourselves
live on the Internet.

58
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,660
But, the issue with Justin.TV,
the thing that,

59
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,670
the thing that sort of, kept
us

60
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,250
from achieving greatness is we
hadn't figured out yet.

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,460
How to how to build towards
anything beyond that

62
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,930
initial TV show.

63
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,650
We knew how to, we built a
great product actually.

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,450
If you wanted to run a live
24/7 reality TV show about

65
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,040
your life, we had the website
for you.

66
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,110
We had exactly, what you
needed.

67
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,640
But if we wanted to go do more
than that.

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,690
If we wanted to open it up to
a broader number of people,

69
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,680
a broader spectrum of people,
a broader use cases.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,520
We didn't have we didn't have
the insight to figure that out

71
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,740
because we weren't that user
and so

72
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,530
at some point we decided to
pivot JustinTV.

73
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,770
We decided we needed to go in
a new direction.

74
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,420
We thought we'd built a lot of
valuable technology but hadn't

75
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,120
identified the use case that
would let it get really big.

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
And there were two directions
that seemed promising.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,270
One of them was mobile.

78
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,230
And one of them is gaming.

79
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,210
And I led the gaming

80
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,030
initiative inside of the
company.

81
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,070
And what we did with gaming
that was very very different,

82
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,410
from what we'd ever done
before.

83
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,550
Was, we actually went and
talked to users,

84
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,850
because while I loved watching
gaming video, I was very aware

85
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,580
that neither I nor anyone else
in the company knew about

86
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,370
broadcasting video games.

87
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,070
And so I would amp up the
content, I thought there was

88
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,950
a market there, that was sort
of the insight that

89
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,690
I had which wasn't common at
the time,

90
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,190
which was how much fun it was
to watch video games.

91
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,350
Quick show of hands, people
know about watching video game

92
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,870
on the internet here?

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,150
Okay, I'm just going to assume
that people listening to

94
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,820
this also know about it.

95
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,490
If you don't know about, if
you don't know about watching

96
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,970
video games on the internet,
you should go read about that.

97
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,450
Because it's sort of,

98
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,940
an important context for the
stuff I'm going to talk about.

99
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,330
But the main point is I
thought

100
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,340
that was awesome but I didn't
know anything about

101
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,210
the side of it that was really
important, which is

102
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,720
actually acquiring the content
to start broadcasting.

103
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,390
So we went out, and we ran a.

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,540
Actually a very large number
of user interviews.

105
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,100
We talked to a lot of people
and brought that data back,

106
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,290
and that formed the core of
all of the decision-making

107
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,190
that was for the next three
years of product features on

108
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,020
Twitch was sort of some of the
insights we got from that.

109
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,640
And we continued to talk to
users, and

110
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,780
in fact built an entire.

111
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,900
Part of the company whose job
it is basically to talk to

112
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
our users.

113
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,640
Which is an, which is

114
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,540
a whole division that we just
didn't even have at JustinTV.

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,970
We had no one at the company
whose job it

116
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,510
was to talk to our most
important users.

117
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,360
So so that was Twitch.

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,170
And I'm, I want to give you
guys a little bit of

119
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,710
a a little bit of an insight
into.

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,130
With Twitch.

121
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,420
What, what that,

122
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,330
what that meant, going to go
talk to users.

123
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,310
So, we determined that

124
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,070
the broadcasters are the most
important people.

125
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,830
And the reason we determined
that, was, when we went and

126
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,780
looked into the market,

127
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,470
we we looked into what, what
determined.

128
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,330
Why people watched a certain
streamer or

129
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,660
went to a certain website.

130
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,060
They would just follow the
content, right?

131
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,400
You had a, you had a piece of
content you loved and

132
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,890
the broadcaster would come
with you.

133
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,950
And that's actually the one

134
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,780
really important point about
user interviews,

135
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,270
which is that who you talk to
is as important.

136
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,150
As what questions you ask and
you pull away from it.

137
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,900
Because if you go and talk to
a set of users, if we'd gone

138
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,640
and talked to viewers only, we
have, a complete different set

139
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,230
of feedback than talking to
the broadcasters.

140
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,680
And talking to the
broadcasters gave us

141
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,310
insight into how to build a
link for them.

142
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,750
That you're not to be
strategically correct.

143
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,520
I wish I could tell the recipe
for

144
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,550
figuring out who the target
user is for your product and

145
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,630
who your target user should
be.

146
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,170
But there isn't a recipe.

147
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,620
It comes down to think really
hard and, and use your,

148
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,710
use your judgement to figure
out,

149
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,820
who you're really building
this for?

150
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,920
So what I want to do is a
little bit,

151
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,334
something a little bit
interactive now, which is.

152
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:57,810
sometging We're going to,

153
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,700
I've got a bunch of ideas
from, from you guys actually.

154
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,460
So, sort of suggested ideas.

155
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,540
And i'm going to pick one of
them.

156
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,580
And I want every one to sort
of sit down and

157
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,250
do, do step one of this
process for me, right now.

158
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,440
Which is think about who would
you go ask about this.

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
Like which people.,

160
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Where would you go to find the
people you needed to talk

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,059
to about this.

162
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,100
In order to in order to learn
about what you should build.

163
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,110
And so the idea you're going
to use is, let me see here.

164
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,340
Of these ideas, so

165
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,020
here it's a lecture focused
note taking app.

166
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,760
The idea is I don't think that
the state of the art for

167
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,530
note taking is good enough
yet.

168
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,800
And I want to make a note
taking app that improves.

169
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,270
You know, improves that
experience.

170
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,730
Makes taking notes in class
better.

171
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,920
Or taking notes by listening
to a lecture online better.

172
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,540
So you know, maybe it has
collaboration features.

173
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,790
Maybe it, like, helps you
focus better somehow.

174
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,390
It has multimedia
enhancements.

175
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,290
I don't know, right?

176
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,700
All sorts of possible
features.

177
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,770
But that's the, that's the
idea.

178
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,950
So take, like,.

179
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,360
Take 120 seconds right now,
and think about not what you

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,730
would ask, or what the right
features for

181
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,770
this app is, but who would you
talk to?

182
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,740
Who should the, who,

183
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,650
who's going to give you that
feedback that's going to tell

184
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,370
you whether this is good or
not?

185
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,950
I actually mean it, right now.

186
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,090
Take your laptop out, like
type, write some stuff down.

187
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,680
Think, think about, like, the,
you can,

188
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,260
it, it's good enough to.

189
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,520
Like think of that in your
head.

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,950
But actually, like if you
actually just write it down,

191
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,650
and like just come up with the
five people you talk to,

192
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,650
the five types of people you
talk to.

193
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,100
And who you think the most
important one was.

194
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,160
LIke, actually do it.

195
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
Because there's nothing like
actually running

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,820
through a practice of
something and trying to do it

197
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,215
to actually get into your
head, the right way to do it.

198
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,950
I"m gratified to see here
clicking in,

199
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,350
of the keyboards now.

200
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,070
If you're following along at
home, pause, actually do it.

201
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,818
Think about who you, who would
you talk to?

202
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:54,618
Because that's a, that is the
first question

203
00:07:54,618 --> 00:08:00,237
for almost any startup that
you need

204
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:05,853
to answer is like who is my
user and,

205
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:10,747
and where am I going to find
them?

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,697
Alright that's like way
shorter than

207
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:26,216
you normally used to think
about this problem.

208
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,764
It's actually a really tricky
problem in, like, figuring out

209
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,900
where to source the people is
pretty hard, but ,.

210
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,310
We're going to move along
anyways in the,

211
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,970
in this highly abbreviated
version of learning how to

212
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,130
build a product and run a user
interview.

213
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,910
So can can I get one volunteer
from the audience to

214
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,550
come up and tell, tell us what
who you would talk to?

215
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,460
And we'll talk about it.

216
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,364
You guys are all pre-selected.

217
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,280
>>
>> Here you go.

218
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,150
I don't know, how to turn this
thing on, here we go.

219
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,432
So who do you talk to?

220
00:09:00,432 --> 00:09:02,987
I would definitely talk to n
college students first,

221
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,370
obviously because we sit in a
lot of lectures, and

222
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,097
specifically I want to talk to
college students studying

223
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,593
different subjects to see if
maybe, you know,

224
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,012
if you're an English major,

225
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,666
if that makes a different,
versus you're studying.

226
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,800
Of not, Computer Science in
terms of how you want to

227
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
take notes in lectures.

228
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
>> And so you,

229
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,670
you're going to talk to a
bunch of college students

230
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,280
Would you pick any particular
subset of college students?

231
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,200
Like we're going to talk to
all college students or

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,300
like a broad array.

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,410
>> I, I went out and talked to
college students.

234
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,230
like, and break down the
divisions by like people who

235
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,500
study different areas maybe.

236
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,580
And then also maybe it would
make sense for

237
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,520
people who have like different
study techniques.

238
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,910
Because some people take a lot
of notes.

239
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,210
Some people don't take that
many notes,

240
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,600
but still jot stuff down.

241
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,230
>> Right.

242
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,890
So I mean that', that's a
really good start.

243
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,980
like that's, that is actually
obviously a group of users you

244
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,080
want to go talk to, especially
if you're targeting something

245
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,020
at, you know, at college
students as the consumer.
