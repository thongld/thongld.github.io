766
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,490
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI
So I wanna try and like
illuminate you know,

767
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,970
some of those potential
fallacies, so

768
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,990
you guys can, can make the
decision in a clear way.

769
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,786
And then I'll talk about
the,

770
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:11,350
the reason I like best for
actually starting a startup.

771
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,000
It's very related to a lot
of what Sam just talked

772
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,670
about but surprisingly I
don't think it's the most

773
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,470
common reason usually people
have one of these other

774
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,600
reasons or they just wanna
start up, you know,

775
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,240
start a company for the sake
of starting a company.

776
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,010
So the, the four common
reasons just to

777
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,280
numerate them are it's
glamorous.

778
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,560
You know, you'll be, you'll
get to be the boss.

779
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,700
You'll have flexibility,

780
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,860
especially over your
schedule.

781
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,990
And you'll have the change
to have, you know,

782
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,860
bigger impact.

783
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,120
And make more money than
you'd,

784
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,590
than you might by joining a
later stage company.

785
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,970
So, okay, so uh, you know,
you,

786
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,010
you guys are probably pretty
familiar with this concept.

787
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,320
When I wrote the Medium
post,

788
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,010
which a lot of you guys read
a year ago uh, I felt like

789
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,560
the story in the press was
a, a little more unbalanced.

790
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,900
You know, entrepreneurship
just

791
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,730
got romanticized quite a
bit.

792
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,250
You know, the movie, The
Social Network,

793
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,190
came out, had a lot of sort
of like bad aspects of,

794
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,810
of, you know, what it's like
to be an entrepreneur.

795
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,609
But mainly pa,

796
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,480
sort of painted this picture
of like.

797
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
There's a lot of partying
and you just

798
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,060
kinda move from like one
brilliant insight to another

799
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,620
brilliant insight um, and
really made it, you know,

800
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,530
seem like this, like really
cool thing to do.

801
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,630
And I think the reality is
just, you know,

802
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,500
not quite so glamorous.

803
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,800
There's sort of a, there's
an ugly side to being

804
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,500
an entrepreneur and also
just more importantly what,

805
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,290
what you're actually
spending your time on is,

806
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,720
is just a lot of hard work.

807
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,660
Sam mentioned this, but
you're

808
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,150
basically just sitting at
your desk heads down,

809
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,710
focused answering customers,
customer support, emails,

810
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,980
doing sales, figuring out
hard engineering problems.

811
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,330
So it's really important
that you kind of like,

812
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,440
go in with, with eyes wide
open.

813
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,170
And then also it's, it's
really quite stressful.

814
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,660
This has been a popular
topic in the press lately.

815
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,110
The Economist actually ran a
story just last week

816
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,850
called like entrepreneurs
anonymous, and

817
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,560
shows like a founder kinda
like hiding under

818
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,240
his desk And talking about
like founder depression.

819
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,800
This is like a very real
thing, like, you know,

820
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,340
let's be real.

821
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,890
This, if you start a
company,

822
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,690
it's gonna be extremely
hard.

823
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,760
Why is it so stressful?

824
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,920
So, a couple reasons.

825
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,240
One is you've got a lot of
responsibility.

826
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,350
So people in any kind of of
career have fear of failure.

827
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,520
It's kind of just like a
dominant part of

828
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,550
the psychology.

829
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,350
But when you're an
entrepreneur your fear of

830
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,980
failure on the behalf of
yourself and

831
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,890
all of the people who
decided to follow you ah, so

832
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,340
that's really stressful.

833
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,870
In some cases these people
are depending on

834
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,620
you for their livelihood.

835
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,230
Even when that's not true,

836
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,850
they have decided to devote
the,

837
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,650
the best of your, years of
their life to following you.

838
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,840
And so you're responsible
for

839
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,180
the opportunity cost of
their time.

840
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,890
So that's a big deal.

841
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,300
And you're always on call.

842
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,920
If something comes up maybe
not always at 3 in

843
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,830
the morning, but for some
startups that's true.

844
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,080
But if something important
comes up,

845
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,860
you're gonna deal with it.

846
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,050
That's kinda the end of the
story.

847
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,290
Doesn't matter if you're on
vacation.

848
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,080
Doesn't matter if it's the
weekend.

849
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,610
You kinda always got to be
on the ball and

850
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,850
always be in a, in a place,
mentally,

851
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,290
where you're prepared to
deal with those things.

852
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,080
And then a sorta special
example of that is,

853
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,410
is or of this kind of stress
is fundraising.

854
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,360
So a scene from The Social
Network.

855
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,517
This is us partying and
working at the same time.

856
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:10,160
And somebody's spraying
champagne everywhere.

857
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,570
You know, so The Social
Network spends a lot of

858
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,680
time kind of painting these
scenes.

859
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,670
Mark's not in the scene.

860
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,516
The other thing they spend
all their time on is

861
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:21,082
kind of like painting how,
him out to be a huge jerk.

862
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,103
This computer?

863
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:23,980
>> Yes.
Oh.

864
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
>> Okay.
So.

865
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,780
This is an, an actual scene
from um, See it.

866
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,350
I'm gonna move this just a
little.

867
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,346
>> Oh, no.

868
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,201
>> This, this will work.

869
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:35,701
>> This will work.
Okay.

870
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,600
On the PDF as well?

871
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,150
>> Yep
>> Okay.

872
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,870
Okay, cool.
This is

873
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,226
an actual scene from Palo
Alto.

874
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,699
Spent a lot of time, his
desk,

875
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,880
just kinda heads down and
focused.

876
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,778
Mark was still kind or a
jerk sometimes, but

877
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,350
in this more like fun
loveable way,

878
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,230
not a like sociopathic
scorned lover way.

879
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,730
So this is him like,
signaling his intention to,

880
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,860
you know, just be focused
and keep working.

881
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,440
Not be social.

882
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,940
>> So then there's also the
scene sort of

883
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,520
demonstrating the like
brilliant insight moment.

884
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
It's kind of like straight
out of A Beautiful Mind.

885
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,040
>> They literally stole that
scene.

886
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,420
So they like to paint it as
you just kinda jump from one

887
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,370
of these moments to,

888
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,630
to the other moment with
like partying in between,

889
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,160
but really we were just at
that table the whole time.

890
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,810
So interestingly if you
compare this to

891
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,900
the other photo, Mark is in
the exact same position, but

892
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,150
he's wearing different
clothes.

893
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,280
This is definitely a
different day.

894
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,650
So cool.

895
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,640
So that's what it,

896
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,880
that's what it's actually
like in person.

897
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,310
And I just covered this
bullet up here.

898
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,460
This is the Economist
article I

899
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,650
was talking about a second
ago.

900
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,660
So another form of, of,
stress is just,

901
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,830
like, unwanted media a,
attention.

902
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,470
So part of it being
glamorous is

903
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,550
you get some positive media
attention sometimes.

904
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,370
It's nice to be on, like,

905
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,600
the cover of Time and, like,
be the person of the year.

906
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,540
It's maybe a little less
nice to be on the cover of

907
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,864
People with, like, one of
your wedding photos.

908
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:56,640
It depends who you are.

909
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,710
Some people would like that.

910
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,890
I'd really hate it.

911
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,670
But when Valleywag like, you
know,

912
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,780
analyses your lecture and
just tears you apart, like,

913
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,800
you definitely don't want
that.

914
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,342
Nobody wants that.

915
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,406
And then, one thing I almost
never hear people talk

916
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,432
about is, you're just a of
more committed.

917
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,050
So if you're an employee of
a startup.

918
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,800
and, you know, things are
stressful,

919
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,010
it's not going well, you're
unhappy, you can just leave.

920
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,930
For a founder you can leave
but it's, it's very uncool.

921
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,720
It's pretty much a black eye
on the rest of your career.

922
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,110
And so you really are
committed you know, for

923
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,300
ten years if it's going well
probably more

924
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,390
like five years if it's not
going well.

925
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,010
So three years to figure out
that it's not going well and

926
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,110
then if you find, like,

927
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,400
a nice landing for your
company,

928
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,050
another two years at the
acquiring company.

929
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,110
And if you leave before
that,

930
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,010
again, it's not only gonna
harm yourself financially,

931
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,170
it's gonna harm all your
employees.

932
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,700
So you pretty much don't um,
so if you're lucky, and

933
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,150
you have a bad startup idea
you fail quickly um, but

934
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,420
most of the time, it's not
like that.

935
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,280
All right, moving right
along um, so.

936
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,400
And I should say,

937
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,640
I have had a lot of this
stress in my own life,

938
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,970
especially in the early
years of Facebook.

939
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,140
You know, I just got really
unhealthy.

940
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,180
I wasn't exercising.

941
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,710
I had a lot of anxiety.

942
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,120
Actually, I threw out my
back, like,

943
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,530
almost every six months,
like,

944
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,490
when I was like, 21, 22.

945
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,020
Which was, like, pretty
crazy.

946
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,890
And so, if you do start a
company.

947
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,730
make, you know,

948
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,540
be aware that you're gonna
have to deal with this and

949
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,800
you have to actually manage
it.

950
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,373
It's actually, like, one of
your core responsibilities.

951
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,864
Ben Horowitz likes to say,
like, the number one rule of

952
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:24,623
a CEO is managing your own
psychology.

953
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:28,710
It's absolutely true, make
sure you do it.

954
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,260
so, another reason so people
especially if

955
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,040
they've already had a job at
another company.

956
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,320
You tend to develop this
narrative of like,

957
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,860
okay like,

958
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,350
the people running this
company are idiots,

959
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,890
they're making all these
stupid decisions,

960
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,050
they're spending their time
in, in these stupid ways.

961
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,970
I'm gonna start a company
and I'm gonna do it better.

962
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,610
I'm gonna like, set all the
rules.

963
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,450
It's a pretty attractive
idea.

964
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,190
Makes a lot of sense.

965
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,030
If you've read my

966
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,590
Medium posts you know what's
coming.

967
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll give you guys a second
to read this quote.

968
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:05,729
Cool.
So this,

969
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,850
this really resonates with
me.

970
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,660
And one thing I'd point out
is you know, the reality of

971
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,450
these decisions is pretty
nu, nuanced.

972
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,320
The people you thought were

973
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,820
idiots probably weren't
idiots.

974
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,720
They probably just had like

975
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,740
a really difficult decision
in front of them.

976
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,700
And people pulling them in
multiple directions.

977
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,950
So the most common thing I
have to spend my time on.

978
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,510
And, and focus my energy on
as a CEO is like.

979
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,680
The, the problems that

980
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,910
like other people are
bringing to me.

981
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,440
The, the other priorities
that people create.

982
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,758
And it's usually in the form
of a conflict.

983
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:36,460
People wanna go in different
directions.

984
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,500
Or like customers want
different things.

985
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,020
And like I might have my own
opinion about that.

986
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,280
But really the, the game I'm

987
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,360
playing is like who do I
disappoint the least?

988
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,130
And like just trying to like
navigate all,

989
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,590
all these difficult
situations.

990
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,500
And even on a day to day
basis I might come in

991
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,100
on Monday and like have all
these, you know,

992
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,700
grand plans for like how I'm
gonna improve

993
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,480
the company and what I'm
gonna spend my time on, but

994
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,660
then if like an important
employee is threatening to

995
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,470
quit, that's what I'm
spending my time on.

996
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,370
That's my number one
priority.

997
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,240
So a subset of you're

998
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,660
the boss is you have
flexibility.

999
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,110
You have control over your
own schedule.

1000
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,130
This really attractive idea.

1001
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,760
So here's the reality.

1002
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,930
And their Phil Libin quote.

1003
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,860
So this, this truly reson,
resonates with me as well.

1004
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,020
And some of the reasons for

1005
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,310
this, again, you're always
on call.

1006
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,320
So maybe you don't intend to
work all parts of

1007
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,859
the day but you might not
get to control which ones.

1008
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,160
You're a role model, this is
super important.

1009
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,980
So if you're an employee of
a company um, you might have

1010
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,670
some good weeks, you might
have some bad weeks,

1011
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,385
some weeks when you're,
you're low energy, maybe you

1012
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,920
wanna take a couple extra
days off um, that's really

1013
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,900
bad if you're, you're an
entrepreneur like your team

1014
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,930
will really signal off what
your bringing to the table.

1015
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,060
And so if you take your foot
off the gas, so will they.

1016
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,210
And you're always working
anyway.

1017
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,310
So, if you're really
passionate about an idea,

1018
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,760
it's just gonna like pull
you to,

1019
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,450
to keep working on it.

1020
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,800
If you're working with great
investors,
