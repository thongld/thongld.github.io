567
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,060
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP176MBG9Tk
We would have them,um,

568
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,490
we would ask them a bunch of
questions.

569
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,410
Over the phone and

570
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,190
then in person we ask them a
bunch of questions too.

571
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,210
And then they would go to a
test clean and

572
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,100
then they would get on
boarded to our platform if

573
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,610
they're good enough.

574
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,470
And so this took a lot.

575
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,240
During all this question
askings for

576
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,440
that many candidates.

577
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,150
You know, we had about a 3
to 5 % acceptance rate.

578
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,610
And so you can imagine all
the people we

579
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,140
were talking to at the
beginning of the funnel

580
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,570
that never even made it onto
the platform.

581
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,400
But what happened over time
was that

582
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,470
we learned certain
questions.

583
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,410
That were asking, were, that
were

584
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,470
indicators of whether
they're gonna be a good, or

585
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,970
a bad, performer on the
platform.

586
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,940
We, threw just like data
collection and

587
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,560
just you know, looking at,
looking at everything,

588
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,790
we could just ask on an
online forum.

589
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,500
So that's when we put on,
put in online application.

590
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,177
They could apply and then we
would ask them maybe several

591
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:13,206
of the questions during the
inter, personal interview.

592
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,850
So it's, if you try to
automate things too fast,

593
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,770
then you run into this
problem,

594
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,310
potential problem of, you
know, not being able to move

595
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,020
quickly on trying to iterate
you know with things like

596
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,620
questions on an application
and stuff like that.

597
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,210
And the third point here is
temporary brokenness is

598
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,780
much better than permanent
paralysis.

599
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,660
By that, what I mean is you
know

600
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,770
perfection is irrelevant
during this stage.

601
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,540
You should, when you get to
the next stage of growth,

602
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,800
like what you're trying to
maybe perfect in this one

603
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,030
stage, is probably going to
not matter anyway, and

604
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,960
so do not worry about all
the edge cases when you're

605
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
building something.

606
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,720
Just worry about the generic
case of who your

607
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,580
core user is gonna be, and
then as you get bigger and

608
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,740
bigger, bigger, the volume
of

609
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,970
those edge cases will
increase over time.

610
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,910
And you'll want to, you
know, build for that.

611
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,880
And lastly, beware of the
frankenstein approach,

612
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,230
which is great.

613
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,400
You talk to all these users,

614
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,410
they give you all these
ideas, you know,

615
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,380
the first thing your gonna
wanna do is go build

616
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,420
every single one of them,

617
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,110
and go show them the next
day and, make them happier.

618
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,320
You should definitely listen
to user feedback but

619
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,590
when someone tells you to
build a feature,

620
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,680
you shouldn't go build that
right away.

621
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,480
What you should really do
is, you know,

622
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,450
get to the bottom of why
they are asking you to

623
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,360
build the feature.

624
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,050
It's usually.

625
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,210
Usually what they're
suggesting is

626
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,180
not the best idea.

627
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,540
But what they're really
suggesting is,

628
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,910
I have this other problem
that you either created for

629
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,460
me while using the product.

630
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,630
Or, you know, I really need
this problem solved before

631
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,670
I'm ever going to pay to use
this product, and so, figure

632
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,470
that out first, instead of
piling on a bunch of

633
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,636
features, which then hides
the problem altogether.

634
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,460
So, you have, so

635
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,840
you have a product, that
you're ready to show, and.

636
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,010
Some people at this point
will continue building their

637
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,226
product and not ship it at
all.

638
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:19,690
And, I think the whole idea
of being stealth and

639
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,810
perfecting the product to no
end is.

640
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:32,270
Is the idea that, you know,
imitation is cheaper

641
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,660
than innovation in terms of
time and money and capital.

642
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,870
And so, I think everyone
should just always assume in

643
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,150
general like, there's gonna
be,

644
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,070
if you have a really good
idea.

645
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,350
No matter when you launch.

646
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,150
Someone's gonna, someone's
gonna,be you know,

647
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,540
someones gonna fast follow
you.

648
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,520
Someone's gonna execute,

649
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,300
as hard as they possible can
to catch up with you.

650
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,410
And so, there's not point in
holding out on all the user

651
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,710
feed back that you can get
by getting a lot of users.

652
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,005
Because you feel like, you
know, you feel paranoid that

653
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,070
someones' gonna do this to
you.

654
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,210
And I hate to keep harping
on it,

655
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,210
but this is things that I
see today with founders,

656
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,810
is something I went through
as well.

657
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,890
And I think unless you're,
unless you're building

658
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,680
something that requires
hundr,

659
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,840
like tens of millions of
dollars just to start up,

660
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,510
there, there's really no
point in,

661
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,390
in waiting around to launch
your product.

662
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,000
So say you have something
that you feel ready to get

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,930
lots of users on.

664
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,490
So what do you do at this
point?

665
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,050
So I'll look at my time, so.

666
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,100
>> 20 minutes.
>> 20 minutes?

667
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,650
Okay.

668
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,400
So, I will go over,

669
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,032
various types of growths in
the next slides.

670
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:46,994
But the one thing to note
here,

671
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,560
early on when you are trying
to get,

672
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,353
when it's just you and your
co-founder and

673
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:56,507
maybe, like, a couple other
people building, you're not

674
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:59,931
gonna be a, you know, create
a team just for growth.

675
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,526
It, it's gonna be one person
and one person only.

676
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:05,209
And so, you need to really
focus and you need to,

677
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:08,154
you should only, you're
gonna be tempted to try like

678
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,800
five different strategies at
one time.

679
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,650
But really, what you should
do is take one channel and

680
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,120
really execute on it for an
entire week,

681
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,740
and, and just focus on that.

682
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,040
And then if that works,

683
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,520
continue executing on it
until it caps out.

684
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,770
If it doesn't work, then
just move on.

685
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,290
By doing this, you will feel
more certain that,

686
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,280
that channel that you were
working on,

687
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,428
that initial hypothesis is
wrong.

688
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:37,650
You'll be, then if you tried
only working a third of your

689
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,520
time on it over the course
of, three or four weeks.

690
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,750
So, learn one channel at a
time.

691
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,060
Second is always be, when
you find channels that work,

692
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,960
you find strategies that
work,

693
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,270
always be iterating on it.

694
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,810
You can potentially give it
to some,

695
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,680
like create a playbook and

696
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,230
give it to somebody else to
iterate on it.

697
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,850
But these channels always
change.

698
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,992
You know, anything from
Facebook ads to,

699
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:05,265
even Google ads, to you
know?

700
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:10,180
But, the distribution
channels the environments

701
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,670
that you don't control,
change all the time,

702
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,390
and so you should be

703
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,690
always iterating optimizing
for that.

704
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,120
And lastly, in the beginning
you're probably,

705
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,220
when you see a channel that
fails you,

706
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,840
just get rid of it and go on
and move on.

707
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,380
There's many other things to
try.

708
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,390
But over time,

709
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,970
go back to those channels
and look at it again.

710
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,260
And so, what I mean by that
is an example is,

711
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,180
in the beginning at Homejoy,
we had no money.

712
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,900
When we tried to do, we
tried to

713
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,410
buy users from Merry Maid,
not from Merry Maids,

714
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,240
that's just an example of a
competitor, but.

715
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,230
We tried to buy Google ads
to get users in

716
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,900
the door quickly.

717
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,060
And what we found was that
Merry Maids,

718
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,240
Molly Maids, all these other
national companies,

719
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,680
they had more money than us.

720
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,310
They were making out

721
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,240
a lot more money on the job
than us.

722
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,910
And so they were able to pay
for users at a much higher

723
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,560
at a much higher, at a much
higher,they were able to

724
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,100
acquire them at a much
higher cost than us.

725
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,010
And so, we couldn't afford
that,

726
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,690
and we had to go to another
channel,

727
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,060
which turned out to be
something else.

728
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,700
But today we make more money
on the job.

729
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,210
We're much better at certain
things, and

730
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,350
so we should probably
revisit the idea of buying

731
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,853
Google ads and buying, going
to the S.D.M. Channel.

732
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:28,910
And so what that's what I
mean by that.

733
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,552
And the key to all this is
creativity.

734
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,900
Performance marketing or
marketing or

735
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,980
growth in general can be
very technical.

736
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,040
But it's actually technical
and

737
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,260
you have to be creative
because if it wasn't,

738
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,310
if it was really easy and

739
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,570
bland, like everyone would
be growing right now.

740
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,860
And so, you always have to
find, like,

741
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,952
that little thing that no
one else is doing and

742
00:32:51,952 --> 00:32:53,898
do that to the extreme.

743
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:58,942
So, here are three types of
growth

744
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:04,290
when yeah, three types of
growth,

745
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,090
sticky, viral and paid
growth and hopefully,

746
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,910
I'll get enough time to talk
about all of this.

747
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,430
So really, briefly,

748
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,700
sticky growth is trying to
get your existing users to

749
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,270
come back and pay you more
or use you more.

750
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,110
Second is viral growth.

751
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,560
So that's when people talk
about you.

752
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,110
So, you use a product, you
really like it,

753
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,850
then you tell ten other
friends.

754
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,280
They like it and that's
viral growth.

755
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
And the third is paid
growth.

756
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,140
So, if you happen to have
money in the bank,

757
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,020
you are going to be able to
perhaps use part of that

758
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,009
money to buy growth.

759
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,980
And the central theme I'm

760
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,610
gonna go through is
sustainability.

761
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,905
There's a lot of, by
sustainable growth I mean,

762
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,570
you're basically not a leaky
bucket.

763
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,590
Money you put in or

764
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,340
time you put in, has a good
return on investment on it.

765
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,600
So, sticky growth is like I
said,

766
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,940
getting existing users to
keep buying stuff.

767
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,430
So, the only thing that
really matters here is that

768
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,750
you deliver a good
experience, right?

769
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,800
If you deliver a good
experience,

770
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,770
people are gonna keep
wanting to use you.

771
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,350
If you deliver an addictive
experience,

772
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,990
people are gonna keep
wanting to use you.

773
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,760
And the way to measure this
and

774
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,850
to really look at this and

775
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:27,420
how you're doing over time
of whether you are providing

776
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,410
good sticky growth is to
look at the CLV's and

777
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,630
retention cohort analysis.

778
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,280
Now, does anyone not know
what cohort analysis is,

779
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,430
or should I go over it?

780
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,570
>> Yeah.

781
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,690
>> Okay.
So I'll go over it.

782
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,300
Okay.

783
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,760
So CLV is some people call
it LTV.

784
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,000
It is called customer
lifetime,

785
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,260
which is, basically the
amount of the net

786
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,650
revenue that a customer
brings in the door for

787
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,000
you over a certain amount of
period.

788
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,950
So, a 12 month CLV is how
much net revenue

789
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,370
does a customer give you
over 12 months.

790
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,470
Sometimes people look at
three months, six months,

791
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,040
and so on and so forth.

792
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,200
So, when I say cohort,
basically,

793
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,220
what you're looking at is,
this is time.

794
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,450
So, let's just call this,
yeah, time.

795
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,260
So, and this is percent of
users coming back to you.

796
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,158
So at time zero, right, a
period zero,

797
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,231
we're at a hundred.

798
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:36,301
I'm using 100%.

799
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,181
So, cohort is another name
also for

800
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:42,837
like customer segments and
stuff like that.

801
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:43,381
So you can,

802
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:45,949
like, you might look at the
female versus male cohort.

803
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,119
People in Atlanta Georgia
verses people in

804
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,015
Sacramento California.

805
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:58,518
But, the most common one is
by month.

806
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:02,850
So, cohort equals month and
lets just say for

807
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,524
this exercise, we are
looking at like March of,

808
00:36:07,524 --> 00:36:10,158
I don't know, 2012.

809
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:15,218
So, March 2012, 100% of
people, you'll have like,

810
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:18,041
that means n equals 100
people.

811
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,079
So, 100% of the people,
obviously, are using your

812
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,498
product because, that's the
definition.

813
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:28,234
Now, one month later, you
might have,

814
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:31,577
this scale is not right, but

815
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:37,020
50% might come back and so,
you come here.

816
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,900
Now, in the second month,
how many people that came in

817
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,510
March, come back two months
later?

818
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,100
And that might be down here.

819
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,560
And, so, over time,

820
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,420
you'll have a curve that
looks like this.

821
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,190
There's always some initial
drop off, you know.

822
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,730
The reasons why people don't
stay after their first use

823
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,970
is, it wasn't worth it, had
a bad experience,

824
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,290
stuff like that.

825
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,950
And then, over time what you
want is, you want this to

826
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,148
flatten out over time, so
that your turn basically

827
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:15,310
goes to 0% that means you
attrition out less, and

828
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,300
less users over time.

829
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,480
And these over here, kind of
become your core customers,

830
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,720
these are the ones that are
like sort of staying

831
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,289
with you for a long time.

832
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,800
And now, court analysis or

833
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,260
using this as a way to show
if you have sticky growth or

834
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:42,270
not is now, say you're, say
we're one year later and

835
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,190
you've built a bunch of
stuff right?

836
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,490
You graph out the same thing
and hopefully what you'll

837
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,920
see is that you have a curve
like this.

838
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,785
That is in the first period
even more people than

839
00:37:56,785 --> 00:38:00,100
50% came back to you and
more and

840
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,290
more people are sticking
with you.

841
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,750
A really bad, retention
curve looks like this, which

842
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,290
is like, after the first use
they just hate you so

843
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,030
much, no, like no one even
comes back.

844
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,480
It's just like zero, right.

845
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,180
And, I don't know what kind
of business that is.

846
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,025
I mean it's obviously a
shitty business, but

847
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:20,780
like I can't explain a good
business that has

848
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,660
a retention curve like that.

849
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,050
So anyway, so over time as
you are thinking of
