730
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,140
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7ZvO5DpIw
I think there was a question
over here too.

731
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,832
Here.
>> So would you consider it

732
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:15,819
intensity of insight to be a
strong signal for

733
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,003
great founders.

734
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:18,695
Density of insight is a strong
signal for

735
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,750
great founders, can you say
another sentence?

736
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,879
>> Being able to distill a
thesis out of or

737
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,853
operate off a thesis.

738
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,082
A deal of doubt to a concise
sentence.

739
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:32,129
>> Well, I would definitely
say that the ability to

740
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,806
say coherently what you're
targeting and

741
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,526
to articulate something.

742
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,113
That isn't trying to boil the
ocean or a Swiss army knife

743
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:41,920
approach but is like one focus
like look if we're right about

744
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,563
this than it works, that is
actually pretty important to

745
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,710
be, to being able to judge a
founder because if

746
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,573
you don't have that level of,
of clarity you're not going to

747
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,646
be able to assemble the
network behind you.

748
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:53,038
You're not going to be able to
get investors,

749
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:54,153
you're not going to get
employees.

750
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,690
You have to be able to
articulate a very

751
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,382
clear mission about what
you're doing.

752
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,763
And insight is helpful
although,

753
00:31:01,763 --> 00:31:05,026
a little bit of this depends
on the stage.

754
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,690
It, it is always, if I find, I
find myself attracted to

755
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,132
founders who've analyzed the
problem a good way,

756
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,857
but, but frequently I've seen
great founders who do not

757
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:14,107
present good analysis but

758
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:16,295
have an instinct about what
they're doing.

759
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:17,413
And so you more chart what
kind of,

760
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:18,423
what's going on around them.

761
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:26,871
>> When Lincoln had like five
years of like I guess

762
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:31,078
Wrap up times, like what, what
can be going to keep like

763
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:34,200
doubling down the original
>> Oh.

764
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,930
So, how do I keep persistence
when,

765
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,260
because, actually, LinkedIn
went through, you know,

766
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,610
let's see, for those who
remember.

767
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:47,060
We were treated as the little
alternative to Friendster,

768
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,558
then to MySpace, then to
Facebook.

769
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,150
Righ.
So, we had a lot of different,

770
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,900
like we're the little tiny one
next to these

771
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,170
respective giants each at the
time.

772
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,570
Ultimately, for me, when I was
thinking about LinkedIn.

773
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,220
This gets back to

774
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,240
the investment thesis as a
mechanism.

775
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,960
I continue to believe the
action fact,

776
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,180
the right economic system
design for

777
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,580
every individual's life and
for

778
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,970
organization's life is to have
public professional profiles.

779
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,000
That world is the way the
world should be.

780
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,960
Everyone is much better off
with it.

781
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,870
And we are getting closer to
that than everyone else.

782
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,500
It may be that it hasn't taken
off as fast as I'd like,

783
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,870
it may be that the general
world is going,

784
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,700
oh this social stuff is really
interesting.

785
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,540
We don't.
Like,

786
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,500
we could only get in the news
in the Fall and

787
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,220
the Summer of 2003 by saying
we were Friendster but for

788
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,770
business, which is completely,
like,

789
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,700
nonsensical once you begin to
look at the thing.

790
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,220
But it was like okay

791
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,980
we'll cover you cause it's
friends but for business.

792
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,630
And that was important to
begin to get people to

793
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,950
pay attention to us.

794
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,270
And so the confidence was that
world I still have

795
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,805
confidence believe that it
should exist and

796
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:51,960
no-one is getting closer to it
than we.

797
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,230
It's taking us maybe longer
than I'd hoped to

798
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,530
get there but that's okay.

799
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,090
So.

800
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,890
Sam?

801
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,690
>> When you get it wrong, when
you meet a fund that you

802
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,580
think is going to be really
good and.

803
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,520
You know, seems to be a move
between these opposing forces.

804
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,420
>> Yup.
>> And on paper it

805
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,890
seems like they're going to go
the distance.

806
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,230
What is it that makes you get
wrong about someone that

807
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,370
looks good at first
observation?

808
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,690
>> Well to some degree you can
only fully cross this kind of

809
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,020
minefield by actually going
and doing it, right?

810
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,530
So you can be wrong about your
hypothesis.

811
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,970
The kinds of things that
frequently get you wrong,

812
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,230
get wrong or when you think
that a person because they.

813
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,520
Like for example, one of the
tests that I frequently use in

814
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,840
interaction is I push on the
idea some, and

815
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,200
what I'm looking for is both
flexibility and persistence.

816
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,860
I'm looking for, no,

817
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,440
I have conviction in what I'm
thinking and I'm arguing it,

818
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,220
but I'm listening to what
you're saying and

819
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,050
I'm adapting to the concerns
and

820
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,720
whatnot of how you think about
that.

821
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,840
Sometimes you'll find someone
who says, look, I've learned

822
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,150
to mimic that behavior, so
I've learned to say for

823
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,760
example I've learned to look,
look like I'm reasoning with

824
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,860
you and I look like I'm, I'm
thinking about the challenge

825
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,080
you're brining up but actually
in fact I'm ignoring you.

826
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,580
Right?

827
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,550
And ignoring me that might be
fine.

828
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,690
Right?
Ignoring the world in

829
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,050
general is usually a disaster.

830
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,700
And so those are the kind of
things that in the measurement

831
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,228
you can see essentially
getting wrong.

832
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:12,513
But usually, the kind of thing
like,

833
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:16,516
most often, the kind of
reference questions I

834
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:21,400
asked about founders is like
adaptability.

835
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,540
Like one of the phrases that I
frequently look for

836
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,210
is infinite learning curve.

837
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,950
Because each entrepreneurial
pattern is, to some degree,

838
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,560
unique and new, and can you
learn the new one?

839
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,418
Huh, right, is a way of doing
it.

840
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:36,310
And so like, does the learning
break down, or

841
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,940
is there some major skill-set?

842
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,970
Is there an ego issue that
gets in the way?

843
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,540
Like, well, I must be the.

844
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,830
Like, everyone, everyone must
adulate me,

845
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,790
and that will cause you to,

846
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,880
to behave wrongly in adapting
to the problem.

847
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,980
Those kind of things.

848
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,480
I think I have one last
question.

849
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,940
The woman in the back?

850
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,990
>> It's a great co-founding
team.

851
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,990
And from your perspective,
what makes a good partnership

852
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,239
when you're evaluating how to
be a great co-founder?

853
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,340
>> Co-founding team,

854
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,010
how to evaluate, and then how
to think about co-founders.

855
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,650
So the first thing is,

856
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,600
it's super important that you
collaborate really well.

857
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,750
That was the kind of the point
I was making during the team,

858
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,010
the initial part of that.

859
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,900
Because, if you in fact, don't
have pretty good serious

860
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,320
trust, you know, kind of a way
of.

861
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,460
It's 150 that I'm supposed to
end, right?

862
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,040
>> 205, man.
>> Oh 205, no, no, no, no I'll

863
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,570
keep going.

864
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:28,540
Sorry.

865
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,600
I, I, I misread the time.

866
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,890
So, I will have time for more
questions, Sorry,

867
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:37,460
I was trying to be time
>> So,

868
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,510
okay, let me give a little bit
longer answer to this, then.

869
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,372
So the key thing is when
you're thinking about founder,

870
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,830
founder se, founders is,

871
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,692
do you have a diversity of the
necessary strengths across

872
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:49,030
the whole range of strengths
that would be useful?

873
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,166
Frequently you need one
technical founder.

874
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,782
At least frequently, you need
to have someone who is

875
00:35:53,782 --> 00:35:55,863
going to be dedicated to the
business side,

876
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,924
fundraising, these sorts of
things.

877
00:35:57,924 --> 00:35:59,700
That's.
Kind of classically skill set.

878
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,282
When you think about the two
to three.

879
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:05,450
And usually, it's kind of some
composition across them.

880
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,420
And that's kind of, like what
you think of as founders one

881
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,250
when you're thinking about a
founding team when you

882
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,750
get the next level deep.

883
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,940
For example, one of the things
that

884
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,360
people will classically tell
you is like for

885
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,720
example don't invest in a
husband and wife team.

886
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,260
And actually, that's look
like, that adds a little extra

887
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,190
freight to it and everything
else cause, you know,

888
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,130
there's personal dynamics also
upset what's going on.

889
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,260
I actually think that what
you're looking for is do they

890
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,540
collaborate well, do they help
each other get to truth.

891
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,580
Okay, so for example I.

892
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,430
Most heartened when I'm
talking to a team that when

893
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,490
they're, when they're
reasoning to each other,

894
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,050
they're not like oh,

895
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,420
we're just all singing from
the same thing.

896
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,190
It's like oh, well did you
think of this or

897
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,280
what about this is a
challenge.

898
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,650
Like you're navigating the
field of

899
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,500
battle which has a bunch of
risks.

900
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,520
Like for example, one of the
things that was pretty common

901
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,610
in PayPal is Max who invented
the prod systems and

902
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,890
everything else would
frequently come into

903
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,820
Peter's office, Peter Thiel,
mass legend and say,

904
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,690
look here is some things that
are going to kill us and

905
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,470
let me focus you on them.

906
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,770
Right so, it's not like we're
all just kind of saying,

907
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,760
oh yes, we're all sitting here
We are adjusting to what is

908
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,940
truth and what's the problem
we need to solve,

909
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,880
what's the problem in the
short term,

910
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,950
what's the problem in the long
term and

911
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,320
how are we tackling it?

912
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,620
And that composition within
the team that collective

913
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,360
problem solving, that
collective learning is the

914
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,880
kind of thing that actually
usually makes great teams.

915
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,630
>> Yeah, thank you for this
wonderful lecture.

916
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,270
I recall Peter Thiel says, we
all dream of flying cars, but

917
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,430
we end up 140 characters.

918
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,040
So let's ask you, you know,
how to identify.

919
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,130
That we found this, you know
different sectors that someone

920
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,921
might would be you.

921
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:46,950
>> Mm-hm.
>> And

922
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,630
then some of the, the common
computing or how to,

923
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,830
how to poll outsiders or the
to for the combination.

924
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,080
>> Yup.
>> Is there a common place or

925
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,040
any
>> So different founders,

926
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,730
different areas, how do you
identify them?

927
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:01,660
So.

928
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,600
The talk was aimed at kind of
what is unique about

929
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,250
the mindset I think of
founders.

930
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,880
That is a great founder across
all founders.

931
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,190
That's part of what this was.

932
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,340
An attempt to say look because
there are difference.

933
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,300
So for example in software,
speed to market,

934
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,480
speed to learning is really
key.

935
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,460
In hardware, if you **** it
up, you're dead.

936
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,150
So, accuracy really matters.

937
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,490
So if you build and ship the
wrong thing, you're hosed.

938
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,080
Generally speaking, as an
investor, and

939
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,730
this is part of the reason why
a lot of investors, you know,

940
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,410
have a certain set of things
that they then

941
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,320
learn pretty well and try to
reapply because they try to

942
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,100
understand a domain well
enough to be able to identify.

943
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,420
Which of the founders in this
domain that really matter and

944
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,950
if we're investing in this
domain,

945
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,850
how do we do that well?

946
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:58,220
And so there are attributes
that are unique per domain.

947
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,232
So, for example,

948
00:38:59,232 --> 00:39:03,930
you know, like if like one of
the classic ones is

949
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,530
how good must you be at
operational efficiencies in

950
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,560
terms of margins, cost
controls, etcetera.

951
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,740
You're dealing in the worlds
of atoms including even in

952
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,990
commerce, you've gotta be
really good at that.

953
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,890
You're doing a digital game
like

954
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,430
a Zinga-like startup doesn't
matter at all.

955
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,170
Right.
So, and so you look for

956
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,800
that kind of fix and
proclivities, and

957
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
part of the beginning of this
is, it's not action fact that

958
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,590
it's one person is good at
everything.

959
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,870
I would be, like, one of the
funniest conversations I

960
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,450
had with a guy, a friend of
mine who worked for

961
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,480
me at my first start-up's
social net.

962
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,110
He looked at me and he said,

963
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,510
Reed, I would never hire you
to be a manager of McDonald's.

964
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,370
I'm like yeah, I wouldn't
either.

965
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,240
I'd be terrible at that.

966
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,210
Right, and so it's, it's the
skill set that fits, but

967
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,930
also the whole point of this
is actually being

968
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,100
navigating a set of things
that look like paradoxes.

969
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,180
Sometimes being heavy on one,
sometimes heavy on the other.

970
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,610
And being, having the right
judgement at the moment in

971
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,570
terms of what you're doing.

972
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,999
And that's what tends to be
more universal.
