00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,480
At the risk of sounding like I'm on drugs,
aren't liquids like, super weird?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,820
Like, the idea that there is stuff out there
that doesn't have a shape?

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,559
How did they get away with not having a shape?!

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,359
And there aren't that many of them.
Like, name a liquid.

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:23,019
My first thoughts were juice, milk and blood, and it's weird that I went from milk to blood, but not that weird!

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,929
They're both produced by the body, and both
were consumed in great quantities by the Mongols.

7
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,100
[Mongoltage]

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,079
I've gotten off-topic; my point is that all
those things are just stuff dissolved in water.

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,979
The only pure non-water liquid that the average
person in pre-modern times would run into

10
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,829
would be liquid fats, produced only by plants
and animals.

11
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,309
Liquids are super weird and super rare.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,040
Only 2 of the 100-something known elements are liquid at room temperature -- bromine and mercury.

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,920
Though there are a few that are nearly liquid
at room temperature.

14
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,039
Check this out; this is a little nugget of
gallium that I got on eBay.

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,219
Number 31 on the periodic table, gallium is
a non-toxic brittle metal, not very useful.

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,299
When it is 10 degrees above the temperature
of this room, it will melt.

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,379
Don't believe me?

18
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,299
Well, you probably do, but if you don't, if I wait long enough, this will actually melt in the palm of my hand,

19
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,719
but I don't want to wait for that, so what's
warmer than the palm of my hand?

20
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:22,108
Everyone, I'm going to put this gallium in
my mouth.

21
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:28,659
It's cold right now. I really hope I don't
accidentally break the Saran wrap.

22
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,719
It's gonna take a little while for all the heat from my mouth to get into that little nugget,

23
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:36,799
but every solid has a temperature and a pressure
at which it will melt and become a liquid.

24
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
Diamonds are liquid at 3,600 degrees Celsius.

25
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,280
And every gas, likewise, has a temperature and a pressure at which it will condense into a liquid.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,239
Titan is so cold that methane is liquid on
its surface.

27
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:50,938
It falls as rain and runs through riverbeds
into methane seas.

28
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,259
Also, I should've mentioned that I'm a trained
professional idiot.

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,509
Do not do this at home.
This is an extremely weird feeling.

30
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,500
It's starting to liquefy in my mouth, and
it's like water, but way heavier.

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,540
It's like, rea--it's metal, so it's heavy.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,899
OK, I think, I feel like it's totally done
now.

33
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,528
So there we have it.
Liquid gallium.

34
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:18,509
Suddenly, the power of my body and it becomes
how liquids are really weird, right?!

35
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,189
Like, gallium, what the heck are you even
thinking?

36
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:30,490
[Theme Music]

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,340
So it's time now to actually figure out for
ourselves what's happening at a particle level

38
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,748
that makes liquids liquid.

39
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:40,239
First, we have to consider that no molecule
is an island.

40
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,278
Molecules and atoms interact with each other
within substances.

41
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:46,498
It's happening because of what we call "intermolecular
forces."

42
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:50,579
They're weaker than the forces that cause
ionic or covalent bonds between atoms.

43
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,400
That's why molecular substances like ice and water can be physically broken or separated into portions,

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,419
while only a chemical reaction can break apart
the molecules themselves,

45
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:04,599
like how water can be split into hydrogen
and oxygen using electricity.

46
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,209
But, do not get me wrong, here. I'm not saying
that intermolecular forces aren't important.

47
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,400
On the contrary, liquids and solids could
not exist without them.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,718
There are basically 2 main types of intermolecular
forces.

49
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,979
There may be 3, depending on how you count
them.

50
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,938
The first is called "London dispersion forces,"
which are most common in London.

51
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:26,128
I'm lying to you; they're named for the physicist
Fritz London.

52
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:28,108
These are the weakest of the intermolecular
forces

53
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:33,019
because they are based on the temporary clustering
of electrons that takes place inside of molecules.

54
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,308
They are most notable in noble gases like
helium and neon,

55
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:39,989
and non-polar molecules like carbon dioxide
or any kind of oil.

56
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,259
And it's not that London dispersion forces
are especially strong in these substances,

57
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:49,159
it's just that there's nothing else holding them together, so even these tiny forces are noticeable in them.

58
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,799
So what makes them work?

59
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,718
Occasionally, in the course of their movements
around their individual nuclei,

60
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:57,188
electrons in a molecule become clustered together.

61
00:03:57,188 --> 00:04:00,430
The region where they cluster briefly acquires
a slight negative charge,

62
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,209
while other regions in the molecule experience
a slight positive charge.

63
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,829
Those positive and negative charges, although small, are strong enough to affect other nearby molecules.

64
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,389
The positive side of the molecule attracts
electrons on adjacent molecules,

65
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,408
while the negative side repels any electrons
that are close to it.

66
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:19,180
These individual attractions are extremely
weak and don't last very long

67
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,060
because the clustering of electrons itself
is short-lived,

68
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,050
but the overall effect of this force is super
important.

69
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,740
London dispersion forces are the only thing
that makes non-polar substances

70
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,410
like methane and even otherwise non-reactive
stuff like helium

71
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,100
stick together well enough to condense from
gases into liquids.

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,780
And we should all remember the lesson of London
dispersion forces:

73
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,839
small, weak things can have important jobs,
too!

74
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,089
Which makes it sound like I think London is
small and weak.

75
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,299
I don't; London is awesome.

76
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,100
The other main type of intermolecular forces
are "dipole-dipole forces."

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,700
As you should recall from our lesson on polar and non-polar molecules, a dipole is a separation of charges,

78
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,829
like areas of partial positive and partial
negative in a polar molecule such as water.

79
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:04,930
Dipole-dipole forces occur when the partial charges in these molecules attract or repel each other.

80
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,699
The molecules orient themselves so that the attraction is maximized and the repulsion is minimized.

81
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,240
It's like 2 colleagues whose very different personalities improve each other's work, like Holmes and Watson.

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,530
They’re a great team, even though they get
on each other's nerves.

83
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:18,859
For instance, partial charges occur in hydrogen
bromide

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,860
because the electrons are more attracted to
the bromide than they are to the hydrogen.

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,550
But the negative charges around the bromines
are attracted to

86
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,850
the positive charges around the hydrogens
on other hydrogen bromide molecules,

87
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,010
and that helps to hold the molecules close
to each other.

88
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,629
Then, there's hydrogen bonding, a special
type of dipole-dipole force,

89
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:35,529
one that occurs on polar molecules that contain
hydrogen

90
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:39,469
and a strongly electronegative element such
as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine.

91
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,880
Because of the very small size of the hydrogen atom and the extreme attraction of its electron to those other atoms,

92
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,649
the dipoles in these molecules are extra strong,
so we actually it a bond.

93
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,569
Really though, hydrogen bonds aren't chemical bonds in the same sense that ionic and covalent bonds are,

94
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,399
but they are the strongest interactions that
occur between molecules.

95
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,799
Water, for example, is very well-known for
its tendency to form hydrogen bonds.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,000
These intermolecular forces, while relatively
weak, are why phases of matter exist,

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,019
and, in fact, it's the relative weakness of
these forces that allows a substance to change

98
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,029
from one phase to another fairly easily.

99
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,489
So, the molecules of a solid are just stuck
in one spot, spinning and vibrating.

100
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,930
Intermolecular forces are what's holding them
there.

101
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,009
But there are always ways to break free.

102
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,639
What phase a material is in has a lot to do with its kinetic energy, and kinetic energy can come from heat.

103
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,019
So, if enough thermal energy is added to a solid, the kinetic energy of the particles increases enough

104
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:40,419
to allow them to overcome some of those intermolecular
forces and flow more freely.

105
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,120
This is the liquid state.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,019
Like, I can smash some ice with a hammer all day if I want to to break it into smaller and smaller pieces,

107
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:53,120
but only a big enough increase in heat will change its kinetic energy enough to make it change phases and become water.

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,860
The particles in a liquid are still pretty
close together, though.

109
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,139
Both liquids and solids are known as "condensed states" because there's a lot of interaction among the molecules.

110
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,759
But, if the particles in a liquid acquire enough kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid,

111
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,349
usually by absorbing thermal energy, those
freed particles comprise a gas.

112
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,490
And the particles in a gas experience intermolecular
forces, too,

113
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,389
it's just that the forces are far weaker than
in the condensed states,

114
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,340
so they allow them to spread much further
apart and interact very little.

115
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,959
Because the gas particles are so far apart,
gases have low density and are highly compressible.

116
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,799
Conversely, the particles in a solid are very
close together,

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,480
so they have high density and can be compressed only a teeny tiny bit, even under huge amounts of pressure.

118
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,560
Obviously, liquids fall between these 2 extremes, but they're much more similar to solids than to gases.

119
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,079
Most liquids are less dense and more compressible than their corresponding solids, but only slightly so.

120
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,579
Makes sense when you think about it,

121
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,879
because the amount of energy it takes to move particles just far enough apart that they can flow past each other is

122
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,879
much less than the energy needed to separate
them completely.

123
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,040
Now, the attraction or "cohesion" between the molecules in liquids give them some important properties.

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,200
For one thing, because all of the particles
are pulled toward the others,

125
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,120
they tend to merge into the most compact shape possible, which, just floating in the air, is a sphere.

126
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,500
But when a liquid can't form a perfect sphere
because it's not in space,

127
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,519
like when it's resting on a surface or filling
a container,

128
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,299
its free edge will curve as much as possible
to approach that spherical state.

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,800
This is easy to observe by overfilling a glass
of water.

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,480
Liquid will pile up on top as long as it can,

131
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,499
until the weight of the water is greater than
the intermolecular forces holding it in place.

132
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:36,139
The overall effect of this behavior
-- called "surface tension" --

133
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,219
is so strong in water that small objects like
paper clips can actually rest on top of it.

134
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,120
Cohesion manifests itself in other ways, too.

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,019
For example, in molecules with very large intermolecular forces -- like the molecules in honey,

136
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,079
which have tons of oxygens and hydrogens just itching to form hydrogen bonds with each other --

137
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,960
the cohesion is so great that it makes the
liquid flow very slowly.

138
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,420
That resistance to flow is called "viscosity," and you can see it in liquids like honey, syrup, oils, glycerol.

139
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:10,019
A third effect of cohesion can be observed by placing one end of a very narrow tube, called a "capillary tube" in a liquid.

140
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:14,698
If the liquid isn't too viscous, it will spontaneously
rise into the tube.

141
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:17,208
This is called "capillary action," and happens
partly

142
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:22,888
because the molecules of liquid that are outside the tube are attracted to the ones that are inside of it,

143
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,409
so they sort of follow them in.

144
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,110
The capillary action also depends on another
phenomenon known as "adhesion,"

145
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,068
or the attraction of molecules in the liquid
to the container.

146
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:34,049
The liquid can't rise in the tube if it's
too attracted to itself.

147
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:37,838
It must also be attracted to the glass, causing
it to cling to the sides.

148
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
If the molecules in the liquid are more attracted
to the container than each other,

149
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,099
they will form a concave meniscus or a crescent-shaped curve at the surface as we see here with water in glass.

150
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,240
And if the molecules in the liquid are more
attracted to each other than to the container,

151
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:54,970
as is the case with mercury and glass, they'll
form a convex meniscus.

152
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,930
So, once again, mystery is answered.

153
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:02,399
The bizarre reality of liquids understood
at the most basic level.

154
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,110
Final question for you all, an opportunity
to use your critical thinking skills:

155
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:13,188
Why, do you think, are liquids so much more rare than solids and gases? Discuss in the comments.

156
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,219
And thank you for watching this episode of
Crash Course.

157
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,699
If you paid attention, you learned that intermolecular
forces,

158
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:21,208
including London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole
forces,

159
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:26,219
and hydrogen bonds attract molecules to each
other, especially in solids and liquids.

160
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,940
You learned about some of the effects of these forces, like cohesion, where one substance is attracted to itself,

161
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:32,868
and adhesion, where it's attracted to something
else,

162
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:38,000
and that those effects cause some unique behaviors in liquids, like viscosity, capillary action, and surface tension.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,899
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

164
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,159
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino, and our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

165
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,778
It was filmed, edited and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

166
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:51,220
Our script supervisor is Katherine Green,
and our sound designer is Michael Aranda,

167
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,980
and, of course, our graphics team is Though
Café.
