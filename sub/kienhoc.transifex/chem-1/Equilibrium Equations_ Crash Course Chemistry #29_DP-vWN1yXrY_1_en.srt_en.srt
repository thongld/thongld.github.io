00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,499
Last week, I told you about equilibrium, which
is proof,

2
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:05,580
if you ever needed proof, that the universe
is trying to mess with us,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,280
because even though we think and talk about chemical reactions as being a straightforward process,

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,410
often times they're also going backwards.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,530
At the same time, the reactants are combining to form products like nitrogen and hydrogen to make ammonia,

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,800
or hydrogen and fluorine to make hydrogen
fluoride.

7
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,769
The products are also breaking back apart
into the reactants.

8
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,059
So there's a sweet spot.

9
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,159
One particular ratio of reactants to products where the products form at the same rate that they break down.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,618
When a reaction hits that spot, it's said
to be in its equilibrium state.

11
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:32,859
A bit of a kick in the head.

12
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,119
But of course you're not totally at chemistry's
mercy;

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,049
you can tinker with chemical equilibrium by
altering the concentration of the substances

14
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,979
and their temperature and if they're gases,
the pressure on them.

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:45,759
For example, adding pressure to the Haber
Process that we use to create ammonia essentially

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,119
shifts the position of equilibrium,

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,308
so the result of the reaction is more ammonia
being produced than nitrogen and hydrogen.

18
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,468
But, wouldn't it be a lot more helpful if
you knew

19
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,448
how much pressure you'd have to add to produce
the exact amount of ammonia you needed,

20
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:03,329
or how much hydrogen fluoride it takes to
refine a certain volume of gasoline.

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,868
Math, of course, is the way to answer questions like these, so today I'm going to show you some simple,

22
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:12,049
totally non-scary calculations that will help
you get a handle on chemical equilibrium.

23
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:21,588
[Theme Music]

24
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:27,519
The first and most important thing you need to do equilibrium calculations is the equilibrium constant.

25
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,498
This number is unique for every reaction and
represents

26
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:36,048
a molar ratio of products over reactants when
a reaction is at equilibrium.

27
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,609
Equilibrium constants are easy to set up but
hard to explain,

28
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:43,848
so let's start with an example using this
obviously fake chemical equation.

29
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,639
The capital letters stand for the reactants
and the products

30
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,248
and the lowercase letters stand for their
coefficients.

31
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:53,738
The equilibrium constant, or Keq, is equal to the product of the molar concentration of the products

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,679
divided by the product of the molar concentration
of the reactants.

33
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,558
Each concentration is raised to the power
of its coefficient in the balanced equation.

34
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:04,239
Now this is important; we're using the coefficients
as exponents here

35
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,239
because we're multiplying all the products
and all the reactants,

36
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
not adding them like you would do in a balanced
equation.

37
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,379
Generations of students have messed up test scores by getting this part wrong, but you will not do that.

38
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:24,120
So again, it's the product of the products of the product of the reactants and the coefficients become exponents.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,319
Actually pretty simple.

40
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,938
The square brackets in the formula are used
by chemists to represent molar concentration,

41
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:32,959
or molarity: moles of solute per liter of
solution.

42
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
These equilibrium constant equations and the
constants themselves

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,449
are one of the few places where you don't
need to write them with every number.

44
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,968
Just remember to convert everything into molarities
before plugging numbers into the equation.

45
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:45,938
One last thing before we do a calculation:
as we learned in the last episode,

46
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:49,328
a change in temperature changes the position
of equilibrium.

47
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,480
Therefore, the equilibrium constant is only
true for a specific temperature.

48
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,738
Constants are normally calculated at 25 degrees
Celsius, which is close enough for most situations,

49
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:00,620
but the temperature should always be mentioned
along with the constant.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,800
Fortunately for us, chemists have already figured out the equilibrium constants for most common reactions.

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Carbonic acid, for instance, which is basically
just carbon dioxide dissolved in water,

52
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,679
dissociates to form carbonate ions and hydrogen
ions.

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,498
You'll see this reaction again later when we talk in depth about carbon and the planet's carbon cycles.

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,560
More importantly, right now, the reaction is perfectly reversible with an equilibrium constant of 1.66 x 10^-17.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,219
For this reaction, Keq equals the product of the molar concentration of the carbonate ion

56
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,560
and the molar concentration of the hydrogen
ion,

57
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:37,498
which is squared because hydrogen's coefficient
in the balanced equation is 2,

58
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:40,098
all divided by the molar concentration of
carbonic acid.

59
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:42,119
Now, let's not be boring and throw a bunch
of numbers around.

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,519
What you need to see is that the quotient on the right must always yield the same number because it's a constant.

61
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,519
So, if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases leading to more H2CO3 in the earth's water,

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,080
the concentration of carbonate ions and/or hydrogen ions must also increase so the total will match the Keq.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,468
You should also notice that any change to
the concentration of hydrogen ions

64
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:08,318
will have a huge effect on the denominator
because its square.

65
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,959
So an increase in hydrogen ions, like if the water were somehow acidified by an outside source,

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,100
would require a huge decrease in carbonate
ions or a huge increase in carbonic acid —

67
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,948
carbon dioxide pulled in from the atmosphere
to satisfy the equilibrium condition again.

68
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,549
We can attack this problem from another direction, too, depending on what information we have to begin with.

69
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:29,759
Chemists often know not only the equilibrium
constant for a reaction,

70
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,560
but also how much of each reactant is available.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
And all they need to figure out is exactly how much of each substance will be present at equilibrium.

72
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:40,418
This type of calculation is easiest using
a format called a RICE table.

73
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,930
RICE stands for Reaction, Initial, Change,
and Equilibrium.

74
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,418
On the R line at the top of the table, we
write the chemical equation of reaction,

75
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:52,839
leaving space between each part so we'll have
room to add more information below.

76
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,638
On the I line we write the initial concentrations
of each substance.

77
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,240
Some of those will almost always be zero, since products generally aren't present until the reaction begins.

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,490
The C line is where we map out how much of
each substance will change during the reaction.

79
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,930
We often don't know exactly how much this
is until we do the math,

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,579
so we start out with x, where the amount is
unknown.

81
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,918
The E line is where we put the final result: how much of each substance will be present at equilibrium.

82
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,079
Since the final amount is just the initial
amount plus any changes that have occurred,

83
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,740
this line is the sum of the initial line and
the change line.

84
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,319
Let's do this for hydrogen fluoride, or HF, an integral part of the process of refining gasoline.

85
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,598
It can be formed in the gaseous state by an equilibrium reaction between hydrogen gas and fluorine gas.

86
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,550
Start by writing the balanced equation.

87
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,960
For our initial concentrations,

88
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:47,478
let's use 3.00 mol of H2 and 6.00 mol of F2
in a 3.00 liter container at a certain temperature.

89
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,769
That makes the initial concentration of H2
3 moles in 3 liters, or a 1.00 molar solution.

90
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,930
Similarly, the initial concentration of the
F2 is 6 moles per 3 liters, or 2 molar.

91
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,098
No HF has formed yet, so it's initial concentration
is 0.

92
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,460
So what we're trying to figure out is how
much of the hydrogen and the fluorine

93
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,388
will react to form hydrogen fluoride under
these conditions.

94
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:08,519
So we'll call the change 'x' for now.

95
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:13,370
Since 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of F2, combine
to form 2 moles of HF.

96
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:20,199
We can say that the H2 and F2 will each lose 'x' moles per liter while the HF gains 2x moles per liter.

97
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,439
That's on the change line of your table.

98
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,978
So that leaves the equilibrium line where
you write your totals.

99
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:32,860
For H2 we have a total of 1.00 - x molar.
For F2 the total is 2.00 - x.

100
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,199
For the HF the total is 2x molar.

101
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,009
Now we apply these figures to our formula
for the equilibrium constant.

102
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:44,081
Based on the table in the back of my textbook, the Keq for this reaction is 115 at the given temperature.

103
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:47,459
We plug in the numbers from our RICE table
and solve for x.

104
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,609
And we end up with this. Which you probably
recognize as a quadratic equation.

105
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,490
Just so you know that doesn't happen with every equilibrium calculation, but it's an extremely common result.

106
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,740
To solve the quadratic equation we have to
use the quadratic formula.

107
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,590
And to do that we have to think of the coefficients
of our equation as a, b, and c in that order.

108
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:09,119
Then we plug them in the corresponding positions
in this formula:

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,348
-b +/- the square root of b2 - 4ac, all divided
by 2a.

110
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,500
Once we finally get all the numbers in the
right places,

111
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,550
it becomes a matter of grinding through some
basic algebra.

112
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,680
And because of the way the quadratic formula
works, we'll get 2 possible answers.

113
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,620
To figure out which one is the right one,
think back to the beginning of the problem.

114
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,300
I said the initial concentration of the H2 was 1 molar, and the initial concentration of the F2 was 2 molar.

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,340
And x is the amount that each one lost, right?

116
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:43,240
Well neither the H2 nor the F2 could possibly
lose 2.13 moles per liter

117
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,598
when they both started with less than that
already.

118
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,259
So clearly, the correct answer has to be 0.968
molar.

119
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,080
Using that then, we can calculate the actual
equilibrium amounts for each substance.

120
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,089
At equilibrium, under these specific conditions
the concentration of HF is 2x,

121
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:02,718
or 2 x 0.968,
which equals 1.94 molar.

122
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:07,509
The concentration of hydrogen will be 1 - 0.968
or 0.032 molar.

123
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,979
And the concentration of fluorine will be
2 - 0.968 or 1.03 molar.

124
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:16,668
As we learned last week, those values can
be shifted.

125
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:21,680
For instance, to maximize the hydrogen fluoride production by adding or removing some of the substances.

126
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,250
Or by changing the pressure or temperature
on the system.

127
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,079
That's why these calculations are so valuable
to scientists.

128
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,120
Just a little bit of algebra allows us to
maximize the benefit that we receive from

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,279
the things that nature is already doing anyway.

130
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,980
If the universe really is try to take advantage of us, we've certainly figured out how to take advantage right back.

131
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,600
So the next time you're wondering why you
learned this stuff in math class, now you know.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,820
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

133
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,600
Today you've learned some mathematical tools to help us make more efficient use of equilibrium reactions in real life.

134
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
You've learned how to calculate an equilibrium
constant, Keq.

135
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,319
You've learned how to calculate the equilibrium conditions of reactions just from knowing their initial conditions.

136
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,640
And you've learned that a RICE table isn't
just a place where you eat sushi.

137
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,419
And you may even have learned a little bit
about the quadratic equation.
