1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,500
You've probably heard this story.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,128
Aron Ralston was out climbing in Utah's Bluejohn
Canyon when a giant rock shifted under his

3
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:11,939
feet, and he fell, pinning his right arm to
the canyon wall. He was stuck, and worse,

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,660
he hadn't told anyone where we was going.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,030
For the next five days, Ralston tried to move
and chip away at the rock. He ate his remaining

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,618
food, drank the last of his water. Eventually
he drank his own urine, and started videotaping

7
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:25,250
his goodbyes.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,149
But then something happened. Ralston had a
dream. He saw himself as a father, picking

9
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:36,289
up his son, and with that vision, an overpowering
will to survive kicked in. He broke his arm

10
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:40,679
bones, sawed through his flesh with a dull
pocket knife, and freed himself.

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,969
Ralston harnessed some of our most powerful
psychological forces -- hunger, thirst, desire

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:51,129
to be part of a family, need to return to
the human community -- they ignited his tenacity,

13
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,628
which allowed him to do an incredible thing.

14
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:55,498
He harnessed the power of motivation.

15
00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:00,530
Obviously, in a big, big way.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,588
[INTRO]

17
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:10,588
In its most basic sense, motivation is the
need or desire to do something. Whether that

18
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:18,439
need is biological, social, or emotional,
and whether that something is making dinner,

19
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,608
going to college, or cutting off your arm,
motivation is what gets you moving.

20
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:28,798
But the big question is, why? Why do we do
anything? I mean, why ever bother changing

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,240
out of my sweatpants?

22
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,078
Psychologists often view motivation in one
of four ways. On their own, none of these

23
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,508
theories is perfect, but taken together, they
help us understand what drives us. Let's start

24
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,039
with the first theory: an evolutionary perspective.

25
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:46,748
For a while in the early 20th century, it
was popular to think of all behaviors as instincts,

26
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:51,949
or innate drives to act a certain way. But
this so-called Instinct Theory was misguided,

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,659
in part because the presence of a tendency
doesn't always mean it's supposed to be there.

28
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,880
Like, we can imagine why a bunch of people
might start rioting at a heated soccer match,

29
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,039
but to say that they're supposed to -- a little
short-sighted.

30
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,739
Evolution is a far more complex, chaotic,
and interesting process than that. Plenty

31
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:11,409
of behaviors could just be accidents of evolution
-- late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called

32
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:16,189
these accidents "spandrels," or traits that
rather than being "adaptive" just stuck around

33
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:18,240
as byproducts of other processes.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,070
Today we define instincts as complex, unlearned
behaviors that have a fixed pattern throughout

35
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,469
a species. For example, dogs instinctively
shake their fur when wet, salmon return to

36
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,599
the stream in which they hatched, and human
babies know how to suckle just minutes after

37
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,530
being born.

38
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,669
These are true, genetically-predisposed instincts
that do not require learning.

39
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:42,000
But today we understand that while certain
tendencies may be genetic, individual experience

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,770
plays a major role in behavior and motivation,
as well.

41
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,520
So another theory of motivation suggests that
a physiological need, or drive, simply compels

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,439
us to reduce that need. This is called the
drive-reduction theory. This can be as simple

43
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,680
as hearing my stomach growl, and looking for
a burrito. My need is food, my drive is hunger,

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,450
my drive-reduction behavior is burrito.

45
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,689
Drive reduction is all about maintaining your
body's homeostasis -- the physiological balance

46
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:07,789
of its systems.

47
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:12,429
As much as we're pushed to reduce our drives,
we're also pulled along by incentives — the

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,540
positive or negative stimuli that either entice
or repel us. The mouth-watering smell of that

49
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,429
burrito pulls me toward it, just as much as
my hunger pushes me there.

50
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,870
However, we're also clearly more complicated
than our homeostatic systems, and drive-reduction

51
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,090
theory may over-simplify a lot of our behavior.
For example, a person may fast for days, ignoring

52
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,729
their body's hunger to honor some spiritual
or political cause; and I know I'm not the

53
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,139
only one who sometimes eats when I'm not actually
hungry.

54
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,829
So a third theory -- the theory of optimal
arousal -- attempts to fill in some of those

55
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,020
gaps. It suggests rather than just reducing
a drive or tension, like hunger, we're motivated

56
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,580
to maintain a balance between stimulation
and relaxation.

57
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,330
Say you're holed up in your house all weekend
studying. You're bored and lonely and gettin'

58
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,000
weird, so you call up some friends to go mountain
biking or to a karaoke bar or whatever you

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,409
like to do to for stimulation.

60
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,859
The idea here is that you want to hit the
right level of arousal -- which, take note,

61
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,320
psychologists often use in a non-sexual sense
-- without getting overstimulated and stressed.

62
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,129
So if you nearly break your face on that bike
ride, or if the Journey covers at karaoke

63
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,399
start getting too intense, you may need to
back off and take a nap.

64
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,279
Of course everyone has a different level of
optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aron Ralston's

65
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,479
was fairly high. Adrenaline junkies may jump
out of planes to hit their ideal level, whereas

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,939
others might be satiated by an engaging book,
or new knitting pattern. No matter which,

67
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,819
the optimal arousal theory suggests that we're
motivated to avoid both boredom and stress.

68
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,550
And obviously not all needs are created equally.
If I'm suffocating and can't catch a breath,

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,860
I'm not going to be thinking about eating
that burrito. And if I'm about to be ravaged

70
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,580
by lions, I'm not going to worrying about
my paycheck.

71
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:55,379
American psychologist Abraham Maslow illustrated
this shuffling of priorities in the mid-1900's

72
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,509
with his famous hierarchy of needs.

73
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,000
Down at the bottom of the pyramid you'll find
our most basic physiological needs for food,

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,939
water, air, and moderate temperatures.

75
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,689
The next rung up speaks to our need for safety,
then comes love and belonging, followed by

76
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:12,290
esteem or respect, and finally, once all those
needs have been met, we have the relative

77
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,560
luxury of being motivated by self-actualization
and spiritual growth, and yoga retreats and

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,699
stuff.

79
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,170
Of course there are problems with Maslow's
vision. Empirical research hasn't really supported

80
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,050
his hierarchy. We tend to skip around on that
pyramid all the time, and the importance of

81
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,460
those higher-level needs may vary depending
on our culture and finances and personalities.

82
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,509
But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest
levels of the pyramid. So, regardless of the

83
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,620
theories about why we have them, most schools
of psychological thought agree that we are

84
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,899
driven by at least three big motivators: sex,
hunger, and the need to belong.

85
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,039
We'll do a whole lesson later about all sorts
of sex-related stuff, including how it motivates

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,639
us. There's a lot there. For now, let's just
say that sexual motivation is how we promote

87
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,319
the survival of our species through recreation
and/or procreation - both of which help human

88
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,870
communities bond and expand. Without it, none
of us would be here today, thinking about

89
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,290
burritos and severed arms and sex and stuff.

90
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,660
Internally, we are biologically driven to
knock boots by our sex hormones. We're also

91
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,689
motivated by psychological and sociocultural
influences - ranging from suggestive external

92
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,730
stimuli plastered all over billboards, magazines,
and TVs in the form of, you know, scantily-clad

93
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,960
bodies sprawled out on beaches to more genteel
desires like love, family, or adherence to

94
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,779
personal, religious, or cultural values.

95
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,888
Sex is a big motivator, but it isn't precisely
a need, no matter what anyone has told you.

96
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,620
People do not die without it.

97
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,340
Hunger, though...

98
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:38,729
After air and water, food is our body's greatest
need, and thus obtaining food is one of our

99
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,450
greatest motivations.

100
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,360
Hunger may seem pretty simple. Eat food, stay
alive. But physiologically and psychologically,

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,270
there is a lot going on. And like so many
things, it starts in the brain.

102
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:54,269
The sensation of hunger usually begins with
a drop in your blood-sugar level. Glucose

103
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,769
is our body's primary source of energy, and
while you might not initially feel it drop,

104
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,089
your brain will.

105
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:05,149
Your hypothalamus monitors your blood chemistry,
and responds to both high levels of the "hunger

106
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:09,979
hormone" ghrelin, and low levels of glucose
by triggering that feeling of hunger reminding

107
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,240
you to eat something. I am in fact experiencing
it right now!

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,290
Once you've eaten that burrito, your metabolism
takes over, converting that food into energy.

109
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,960
But while our physiological need for calories
varies depending on our body size and composition,

110
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,709
your gender, and your age, our hunger is also
shaped by our psychology, culture, and mood.

111
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:32,198
And these factors don't just rule when we're
hungry, they also guide what we're hungry

112
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,620
for.

113
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,800
Biologically speaking, most humans, and many
other animals, have a genetic taste for sweets

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,900
and fatty foods, because they're typically
high in energy. But other taste preferences

115
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,329
are conditioned through experience and culture.

116
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,899
I may have an aversion to oysters because
they once made me sick, and love gingerbread

117
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,698
cookies because my grandma used to make them.
Although popular in Cambodia, I'm not too

118
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,860
keen on eating fried tarantulas, just as lots
of folks around the world think that the very

119
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,800
idea of peanut butter is gross.

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,620
Still, the feeling of hunger affects us the
same.

121
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,069
During World War Two in the US, some conscientious
objectors volunteered for medical research

122
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,579
as an alternative way to serve their country.

123
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:11,228
Perhaps the most famous of these studies was
physiologist Ancel Keys' Minnesota Hunger

124
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:15,899
Experiment, which measured the effects of
semistarvation, by partially starving its

125
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,879
volunteers.

126
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,709
While ethically dubious, the experiment was
geared toward understanding the many small

127
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,589
and large effects of hunger, which was plaguing
Europe at the time.

128
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:31,289
The study started in 1944, by feeding 36 young,
healthy men a normal diet for three months,

129
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,079
then halving their caloric intake for six
months, then slowly rehabilitating them to

130
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:38,168
normal weight during the last three months.

131
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:43,458
They ate mostly wartime-foods like root vegetables,
bread, and pastas, and were required to walk

132
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,948
22 miles, and participate in various work
and educational activities, for 40 hours each

133
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:54,118
week. The goal was to see a 25 percent drop
in body weight during the starvation period.

134
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:59,089
As you can imagine, the changes were dramatic.
The men became gaunt and listless, and showed

135
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,869
a decrease in strength, heart rate, and body
temperature.

136
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:06,240
But the psychological effects were perhaps
even more dramatic. The men became totally

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,490
obsessed with food. They dreamed about it,
talked about it all the time, read cookbooks.

138
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,068
They lost interest in sex and jokes and social
activities. They were irritable, anxious,

139
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:15,889
and depressed.

140
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,860
In the end, they were all rehabilitated, but
the study gave us some understanding of the

141
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,490
devastating psychological effects of starvation.
It also showed us something of the social

142
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,360
effects, as the men withdrew from one another
and isolated themselves. As one fundamental

143
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,899
need was frustrated, these men experienced
the decline of another - the need to belong.

144
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,860
Humans are social animals. Evolutionarily
speaking, it's fair to say that social bonding

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,278
has helped us survive. It's a tough world
out there, and we've got a lot better shot

146
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,419
at thriving if we're sharing resources and
responsibilities, protecting and supporting

147
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,318
each other in groups.

148
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:51,169
That isn't say you need to be joined at the
hip with everyone--our social needs have to

149
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:55,979
be balanced with our autonomy, or sense of
personal control, so we feel both connected

150
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,869
and independent.

151
00:09:56,869 --> 00:10:01,420
But sometimes we're denied that sense of belonging.
We've all experienced the pain of being ignored

152
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,099
or rejected at some point in our lives. It's
worse than just about anything.

153
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,339
The evidence for this is abundant - one recent
study suggested that teenagers who had a sense

154
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,889
of belonging to their community had better
health and emotional outcomes than those who

155
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,399
didn't feel like they belonged.

156
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,759
Cultures all over the world actually use ostracism,
or social exclusion, as a type of punishment.

157
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,639
Whether it's kids in time-out, adults in exile,
or prisoners in solitary confinement, separation

158
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,490
feels like a punch in the gut.

159
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,470
Never underestimate the power behind what
motivates us. The need to survive, the need

160
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,160
to belong... if you can harness that motivation,
you can do just about anything. Just ask Aron

161
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,428
Ralston.

162
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:38,919
If you were motivated to learn today, hopefully
you took in four theories of motivation including

163
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:43,578
the evolutionary perspective, drive-reduction,
optimal arousal, and Maslow's hierarchy of

164
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:47,388
needs, and how sex, hunger, and the need to
belong motivate us.

165
